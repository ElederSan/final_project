Shipment to Austria was very quick, tracking and delivery by GLS perfect2. The Welding DeviceFirst welding tests with stick electrodes (MMA) were fine, ignition, arc stable.I measured the current with a Fluke clamp on meter and checked the deviation. At 100 and 110 Ampere the measured current was almost exactly the adjusted one.At lower current like 50 and 55 Ampere the measured current was slightly lower (~ 3 Amps).I think that's pretty good for such a nonprofessional device.No tests with TIG (WIG) welding so far, but planned for near future...3. Customer supportI had a few questions - prompt response, polite.But one thing I have to mention:An answer to a specific question was not correct:They said the plug has a 13 mm socket.

I received it over 2 weeks later. I didn't need the pot by then, as I had needed it for the 11th of August.I queried my refund several times since then to receive feedback stating ""we will continue to monitor this return and can refund you as soon as I get confirmation from our UK return centre. Rest assured, we are checking daily for the status of the parcel"" - seriously? I am extremely disappointed as it is now over 7 weeks later, and I have still not received a refund.
