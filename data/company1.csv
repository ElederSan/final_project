Fab app and dead easy to sign up,after asking for and receiving a 2 week break to make my monthly payment due to cash flow brought on by the corona virus  i was bombarded with texts and emails to the point when i had to tell them it was bordering on harassment but the reminders kept coming the sooner i clear the balance the better,26-Aug-20,5,Vanquis Bank;
"after asking for and receiving a 2 week‚Ä¶,""I took out a Vanquis Loan and made all my payments on time.  I also made several additional payments so I was able to end my loan early in November 2019 - great news or so I thought.  I had also paid too much and received a refund on what I had overpaid.  I was therefore amazed when I noticed on my Experian Credit Report that I had made a late payment.I raised this with Vanquis, and the advice I was given was nonsense.  I ended up making a complaint to Vanquis in December 2019, which they upheld in February 2020,  reference Cat/00289166.  To rectify the mistake, I was offered ¬£50 compensation and that they would remove the incorrect entry from my credit report.I received the compensation, but to this day (August 2020) they have still not removed the incorrect entry on my Credit Report.  I have raised a complaint with the FCA.Until this point in time, I had no problem with Vanquis.  They had always been very helpful and knowledgeable.  But this experience would make me suggest that if you are considering taking out a loan which you may end early through additional payments, just don't go there."",26-Aug-20,1,Vanquis Bank";

Fine for the first 4 years, unacceptable for the last 3 months,During this pandemic whilst I‚Äôve been furloughed Vanquis agreed a payment freeze on the account.
