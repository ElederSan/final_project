5773fcb40000ff00096b0985,Very slow with delivery,29/06/2016,3,It was not in stock and it required my husband emailing them a couple of times until it was in stock to deliver.,GB
576e44420000ff00096998c4,Not a great service,25/06/2016,3,"My first mower was lost in transit, this was replaced but still did not arrive on the day stipulated.",GB
576996b90000ff000968a30c,"Good communcation, ignored",21/06/2016,3,Items could not be delivered as specified. When asking for items to be delivered I specified a specific day well within the capabilities of the delivery company. Delivered on the day I was not there and caused confusion to both myself and the delivery company.,GB
57670bf50000ff000967d2a7,In many ways a very professional company,19/06/2016,3,"When I placed my order, they phoned two days prior to delivery, to make sure everything was correct and that there'd be no problems. And to remind me to check my lawn tractor over before the delivery man left.Unfortunately, it didn't quite go to plan!The delivery was at the stated time. Unfortunately, there was a labelling problem in the warehouse and the guy delivered the wrong machine (and left for Kent with my machine, which was the second delivery of the day).This was compounded by the van driver (nice guy, very helpful) forgetting to wait whilst I unwrapped the machine. This was a shame as he could have taken it back there and then but I had to have it picked up later that week (and the correct machine after that).So it was a couple of errors that added up to three deliveries/pickups instead of the one as expected.To be fair, Mowdirect refunded my delivery charge immediately and the courier company kept me informed of the new pickup/delivery times.So I wouldn't put anybody off the company but it is the perils of internet shopping really, that these sort of errors happen - has happened to me before with a different company (eg - this issue is nothing compared to the nightmare I had with AppliancesDirect).",GB
57633f790000ff000966f623,ordered not been sent out.,17/06/2016,3,"When I first ordered the mower the assistant said it would be here the next day despite it was Wednesday after 2 pm.When it did not arrive on the Thursday I rang to check order would be here on the Friday . after a wait while they were trying to track the order they told me that they could not find the order.Then after await again they returned to say that the order did not even leave the depot. I was annoyed about this has I had waited in all day Thursday for a order that had not been sent out ,also if I had not have checked I would have waited in all day Friday and was told the mower would not be out for delivery until the Tuesday as it was the Whit bank Holiday.Hardly good enough for next day delivery . Also I would have not known if I had not rang rang up myself .Not the next day service I was thinking off but it did arrive on the Tuesday after the Bank Holiday.",GB
5762e9b10000ff000966dc44,no spark plug spanner and poor customer service when asked which type I needed.,16/06/2016,3,Really could do with providing a basic spark plug spanner with machine as they are not easy to find and essential for maintenance. Customer service was very unhelpful not knowing what size fitted my machine. A lot of time wasted. Handbook and instruction leaflets - very poor quality.,GB
576189850000ff0009666f26,less timely delivery than i would have liked but they did ring to alert me to the delay.,15/06/2016,3,Would use them again.,GB
576137bc0000ff0009664992,Could do better,15/06/2016,3,"Contrary to their advert, I had not heard from MowDirect for several days after placing my order, I contacted the sales dept to ask for an update on the delivery of my goods. I was told the order had been placed on hold due to my location that required a delivery surcharge, I told the sales staff I wasn't paying for a surcharge and to cancel the order. the sales staff then assured me that I would not have to pay surcharge and the goods were delivered within the next couple of days.The crux of the matter is, if I hadn't inquired would I still be waiting for my order?RegardsW Sharp",GB
575d80a70000ff0009652cbe,Disapointed,12/06/2016,3,Received next day as stated but without a harness phoned next day to complain and after two phone calls and two weeks received said harness,GB
575d756d0000ff00096529b3,Used equipment,12/06/2016,3,"The situation here is a little unusual and not typical of this company. I called Mowdirect to enquire about a petrol powered Lawn Raker. They said they had one in excellent condition with only 4 hours usage at a good discount so that is the one I agreed to purchase. I live not too far from them so I went to collect.  On returning home I opened the box to find the raking cylinder missing and one of the wheels broken. I called them straight away and they immediately refunded the charge and arranged to pick up the item.I have no quibble with the staff there,  they are very pleasant and helpful and dealt with the problem without hesitation. I have also purchased there previously with no problems and would normally rate them with 5 stars. However, if purchasing something used, get the item checked before it leaves their warehouse, especially if you are collecting.",GB
575aeabc0000ff000964aa12,Delivery issues,10/06/2016,3,Don't order if you live in Scotland and want next day delivery. I ordered my mower over the last bank holiday weekend (Sunday) so did not expect next day delivery. However I got a call from them Tuesday saying mower was not in stock which annoyed me. I had checked out other Mower suppliers and the particular one I wanted did show up as out of stock unlike Mower Direct. It should advise you when you put in an on-line order about this. Quick to take your money. I had an email Thursday  to say mower was on its way! I did not receive my mower until the following Wednesday!!  I was informed after I emailed to see when the mower was to be delivered that DpEx the courier don't deliver everyday in Scotland.  Next day delivery is not guaranteed. That's not acceptable in my book?!ðŸ˜¡,GB
575a94c70000ff0009648902,Little communication,10/06/2016,3,"Bought an expensive lawnmower , the site stated next day delivery , it never arrived for 4 days, no communication until I raised a complaint.Lawnmower then arrived when nobody was in the house, dumped on the middle of the front lawn , no card through the door or anything!Could easily have been stolen?The service needs improved, after all I am only the customer",NL
5758517a0000ff000963ea29,product good but poor delivery service,08/06/2016,3,Product was as described but delivery was poor . Didn't arrive next day as stated even though I waited around on site all day . No contact made by courier untill later in evening to say it would be delivered on the following day.,GB
5756e6470000ff0009636e95,Poor customer support,07/06/2016,3,"The website made a claim of ""free next day delivery "" which is the only reason I made the purchase - I received it 4 working days later! When I complained I was told that it stated up to 5 workings days on website. I asked several friends to take a look on the website and apparently they are all incompetent readers too as they saw ""free next day delivery ""!The good news is that the mower is fine apart from one issue. The construction of the drive handle is horrible and it pinches your hand.",GB
575193450000ff00096229a9,Late delivery,03/06/2016,3,Delivery was three days later than expected.  I also suspect that if I had not kept calling it would have been even later,GB
574eb8fe0000ff0009614120,Response to problem,01/06/2016,3,After prompting mower was dispatched and arrived quickly so but no response to date now that I have questioned performance of the mower.,GB
574c6e5f0000ff0009609347,Mower arrived damaged,30/05/2016,3,It was disappointing when I opened the packaging of the mower I had ordered that it was damaged and unusable.  My email was responded to quickly and a replacement was received within 48 hours.,GB
574998590000ff00095ffb7e,work it out yourself,28/05/2016,3,"a good machine but the delivery was not a pleasant experience , admittedly we don't have a good access but thought it was not a good delivery to leave an 83 yr old man with a tractor mower on a pallet , not a clue how to get it off the pallet or how to drive it , all the while it was blocking a footpath , no information whether there was fuel in it or where to put it , not a great experience but think it is a good product and value for money..",GB
57496a8c0000ff00095ff0a8,"Some good, some not so",28/05/2016,3,"I chose MowDirect to buy my new lawnmower because they have a really excellent web site, and promise a lot by way of customer care. They had every mower that I was interested in, and a few I'd never heard of, so choice wasn't a problem, and their prices were generally as good as anyone's.I eventually decided on a Wolf Garten with free next day delivery as I'd ordered at 12.36 pm, an hour and a half before the deadline. The purchase process was completely painless, and I promptly received various emails welcoming me to MowDirect, detailing my purchase, and informing me that I'd get another email with delivery information.By 11am the next day I'd heard nothing about my delivery, so I emailed their customer support to find out what was happening. They never replied.The following day, my mower arrives unannounced, and by pure luck my husband was in to accept it. 30 minutes later I get an email saying my mower has been dispatched, and should arrive in the next 1-2 working days. So much for next day delivery. And so much for their much vaunted customer service.The mower's great, but I have Wolf Garten to thank for that. Sorry MowDirect, first rate web site, but your service is nothing to get excited about.",GB
57480f220000ff00095f9a41,ok but room for improvement,27/05/2016,3,Price was competitive but delivery was poor. I ordered two items and they were not consolidated into one delivery. I was told a delivery day and the items didn't arrive. I phoned and asked when they would arrive and was given a new day and still didn't arrive. I ended up taking 3 days off work for one order so the good price was effectively wiped out. One item was not put together as expected so even more time wasted.,GB
5745a02a0000ff00095ee96f,MowDirect performance.,25/05/2016,3,"Although I found the people I talked to about the purchase I wanted to make very pleasant & helpful, the whole process was very confused & unreliable. After promises of delivery dates, these were never realised & in the end I resorted to buying a mower that they had in stock. Even after this was delivered, I received further emails promising delivery of another mower.All rather unreliable & confusing.",GB
5745913a0000ff00095ee39d,Great if you have no problems with the mower when delivered.,25/05/2016,3,"Placed my order on the website, it didn't show out of stock, desperately needed a new mower as my old one had died. The grass was growing at some speed so needed something fast. I waited a few days, they say they can deliver next day if ordered in time, but nothing turned up, so I contacted them only to be told that the model I ordered is out of stock and they had no idea when they would get a delivery in. So I asked if they offer a similar alternative, they did, it was Â£20 more but they agreed to knock off Â£10 of that. The mower arrived next day. Great! Until we assembled it and couldn't get it to start, nor could we get the choke lever to move at all. So called the customer service line, they then had to get a technical man to call me back. I talked through the problems, he said they would have to have it back, and said that he would contact the customer service team to explain. I then had to wait over the weekend, I heard nothing back so midday on the Monday I contacted them again to organise the return of the mower. The mower now had oil and fuel in it (my fuel at my cost) so I had to wait for the delivery man to be in the area which wasn't going to be till the Friday. It then wasn't going to be looked at until the Tuesday and I am still awaiting to hear back as to when I will get a refund! Until then I cannot go out and buy another mower! Thankfully a friend brought his mower round and mowed my lawn for me, otherwise I would literally have a jungle to mow through by the time this is all sorted.",GB
5742ef4c0000ff00095e0a55,Mountfield 1530H,23/05/2016,3,"Great product but the delivery was very odd.The delivery was handled by an independent courier who called to say the item would be delivered on the Thursday but could not give an approximate time and they left no phone number or tracking number.The lawnmower was delivered built into a wooden pallet. There was no guidance on removing the pallet and so I ended up calling MowDirect and it was suggested that the front blocks should be ""knocked off"" and then 2 planks used as ramps to drive the mower off of the pallet?This I did but I am fairly fit and this would be tricky for an older person.Given the price paid I expected a better delivery service than this.",GB
5742c51c0000ff00095dfa21,Could of been better !,23/05/2016,3,"Very disappointed that despite the mower I choose was showing as ""In Stock"" it actual was not, then chose a 2nd Mower that I was told on the phone was in stock, when it did not turn up, I was told that the one they had was faulty, so finally choose a third mower I was initially told that if I wanted it next day, it would be Â£35 extra. After complaining a Supervisor over rode that and arranged for a timed next day delivery.The mower then arrived on time and was excellent. The driver was very helpful and I am now pleased with my purchase, but it was a shame the initial experiences nearly resulted in me cancelling the order.",GB
573c59d00000ff00095c6737,Stock needs updating,18/05/2016,3,"Ordered a machine, expecting it to be delivered the next day. I Phoned up out of stock,not expected for 3 weeks....... In fairness I cancelled and had a machine in stock, which was delivered the next day. Website needs to clarify availability .",GB
5734394b0000ff00095a42e8,Despatch information.,12/05/2016,3,"When I placed the order on the webb site I was informed that I would receive an email which notified me that my order had been despatched. In that email I would also receive a tracking number number so that I could locate my order. This did not happen! I received the confirmation email but no tracking number. I emailed the company, they said because it was coming from their depot they didn't have a tracking number, but that the order would reach me by 6:00pm that day. It did not arrive until midday of the following day!",GB
5730b8720000ff0009592841,Let down by delivery,09/05/2016,3,"Despite online tracking facility the courier delivered to a neighbouring address (despite us being at home), left no card to say delivery had been made or where to, and when contacted has still been unable to provide a delivery address despite repeated requests. Fortunately one of our neighbours came round two days later to say they had signed for it and it transpired that it was delivered to them a day in advance of the date and time on the tracking service !",GB
5728d65a0000ff00095723e2,Poor unloading experience,03/05/2016,3,"Customer service was 1st class up to the point of when my Ride On Mower was unloaded from delivery truck.... It was left on a pallet,shrink wrapped ...I expected the delivery drivers to unload,unpackage,help to get mower off the wooden pallet & inspect for any damage....this did not happen... Therefore I am rating at 2 stars",GB
5727532d0000ff000956a2d4,stock levels don't match websites stated levels,02/05/2016,3,"It took 2 attempts to but my strimmer. The first attempt, despite the website stating availability, I was rung up 4 days later to be told there was a 4-6 week wait for delivery! I decided to buy an alternative and in fairness no payment was processed. On the second attempt, again with the website stating availability, I was rung again to state the strimmer would take 7 days to be available. I went with it and it arrived 9 days later. Product is fine, matches decription and i'm happy with it, i'm just annoyed the website states rapid delivery and its plainly not true! If you are merely a shop front with no actual stock it should state this.",GB
572389fe0000ff000955e49b,Some mixed experience,29/04/2016,3,"Ordered product on line expecting delivery 2 days later. Having not received any delivery message I called Mow Direct to be told it was out of stock and the next delivery was in a weeks time. They really should have called me with this information.Was expecting a 2 man delivery, as it was a 42kg load. Only 1 person came with the delivery meaning I had to help carry thee machine from roadside to back garden.The web site was helpful when trying to select the right machine for our size and uneven garden.Alan Lynes",GB
572326740000ff000955be3e,"Item I wanted wasn't in stock, but website said otherwise",29/04/2016,3,"Ordered a specific model of lawnmower hoping I would get next day delivery as stated on their website. However after 4 days of waiting I sent an email asking where my product was. I then received a phone call stating that the item I ordered was not in fact in stock and I would have to choose something else. I'm happy with the alternative model, but just not ideal service.",GB
5718789f0000ff000952db47,Order was not fulfilled until I contacted mowdirect after 7 days,21/04/2016,3,"My order was later than expected due to a problem with mountfield,s processing system,but nobody told me anything until I sent a follow up EMail after 7 days,to ask for an update.Poor communications between customer and mowdirect and between mountfield and mowdirect are the reasons for my score.",GB
5717cf2f0000ff000952bad5,Timely delivery but operational problem,20/04/2016,3,"The ordering and delivery process were fine. Pre-ordering I visited the shop at Hempnall and was given help to make a choice and shown a couple of scarifiers to assist.Putting the scarifier together was fairly straightforward. It started up without effort. I then started to use the scarifier on the lawn, and after a few runs up and down, a nasty grinding sound started up from the underside. I phoned MowDirect and was advised a tech would phone me back in the afternoon. Meanwhile i checked the fan belt and found the bottom pulley bolt very loose and the pulley almost coming adrift. I tightened this up and the noise was a lot less, but I was not satisfied that it was running as smoothly as when first started. Just prior to shop closing in the afternoon I phoned again and did speak with a tech who asked that I drain the petrol and oil from the machine and it would be collected. I did that the next morning and phoned to say it was ready for pick up. I was told the machine would be replaced as the experience I had had was something some others of the same type had shown. However, the replacement was out of stock and due later this week. Hopefully that will be tomorrow (Thursday) or Friday. The collection will be made at the same time as delivery of the replacement. So I am now hoping the replacement will behave itself. I have lost a little confidence in the assembly quality, but will try again once the replacement arrives.",GB
5707df1a0000ff00094e4db3,The machine I bought is fine but delivery service was poor,08/04/2016,3,I ordered a scarifier on Wednesday evening and expected it to be despatched on Thursday and delivered on Friday. I phoned on Friday afternoon and it took 5 minutes to trace my order - I was advised that it would be despatched on Friday and would be delivered on Monday. It did not arrive on Monday (the tracking facility told me that it was at my regional depot on Saturday but did not have a delivery time). The item was delivered on Tuesday by a subcontractor who told me that he regularly worked my area but only delivered on Tuesdays and Fridays. If MowDirect had told me that delivery would be Tuesday I would have been content - it is time wasted hanging around for a delivery that is never going to happen that is annoying. Better communication please!,GB
5705290b0000ff00094d73a4,Mixed Experience,06/04/2016,3,"I bought a new mower from MowDirect as their price was very competitive.  I was told there would be a slight wait and, true to that advice, the new machine turned up about 3 weeks later.It proved to be defective.  MowDirect were quite responsive initially but wasted no time in stepping back from the problem and passing me on direct to Mountfield to sort out a repair/replacement.   The exchange mower is due to arrive tomorrow - hope it's okay as I'll face another round of phone calls if it isn't.Throughout all this there has been no expression of regret from MowDirect and I got the impression from this that they weren't really that bothered about customer care.  This may be a wrong impression but that's not my fault. I'd suggest t6hat customer care is something they could engage with more convincingly.",GB
5705051e0000ff00094d6335,Disappointing,06/04/2016,3,The mower was not complete and I'm still waiting for parts to turn upI've been in contact with them but still don't have the parts I need,GB

5704141c0000ff00094d26ba,Reliable but temperamental,05/04/2016,3,"Bought this scarifier at the weekend so we could do our big lawn that was full of moss. The machine took the lot after 2 goes, but in between works, it stalled or stopped, then half way through we lost the belt that had come lose, then we lost the wheel bolts which needed replacing as we lost them in the grass. Apart from that it did the job, however the problems got frustrating and we lost 1 hour out of the 4 hours, trying to restore the problem.",GB
56fbc4ef0000ff00094aeb30,Some problems need addressed,30/03/2016,3,"The good news is the machine was beautifully packed an delivered undamaged.The bad news is the delivery was made on Tuesday and not Wednesday as requested. I should have been out on Tuesday but by chance was home when the delivery was made.The pallet was screwed together with ""TORQ"" screws which I would say are not common in the domestic world. I had to resort to a crow bar to remove the wheel blocking bars. What is wrong with Philips or cross head screws?The delivery driver failed to point out the notice saying I had 15 minutes to inspect and record on the delivery note any missing item. The driver simply asked for a signature and was long gone before I noticed the ""Notice"" and then took a further 20 minutes to unwrap. Fortunately again everything was there.Finally the operating instructions left much to be desired, but having an engineering background was able to work through them. I would have had a hard time assembling this machine from the details supplied so it was fortunate that the machine was ready built.As the grass is not yet growing, I have only fuelled, oil checked and run the machine. It looks the part and would be surprised if it does not perform, will let you know in due course.",GB

I had to connect the battery (which wasn't straightforward) still wouldn't start. Mow direct not much help as they order in the machine and were not familiar with it. I charged the battery still wouldn't start. Mow direct then arranged for an engineer to come who found that the connection to the ignition had been wrongly connected. He corrected it and the mower started. I would have expected a Â£1300 machine to be checked before dispatch.,GB

I was given the opportunity to choose my delivery date, which I did and which was accepted by the delivery company. Or so I thought. Despite reiterating my delivery request, I returned home to find my delivery, in the front garden, facing the main street, trying in vain to hide it's bulk behind my rubbish bin. That same day I received an email, from the delivery company, informing me that my delivery would be with me the following day. Which is what I requested.

Waited in all day but only on ringing MowDirect towards the end of the day did I discover that I wasn't going to receive it until the Friday. I was not happy at all and on expressing this to the lady at MowDirect she became quite unpleasant and rude and just kept repeating that they do not guarantee next day delivery and that it wasn't their fault. I pointed out that it wasn't next day delivery as I had ordered it 3 days previous.

I still don't know whose fault it was - Mowdirect or the delivery company.

It had been put inside another larger outer box before labelling and despatch, so it's not like this is something that happened with the couriers.

Unfortunately, the third-party delivery company had put the pallet with the mower on it on another pallet, making it impossible to get it onto the ground. As far as the driver was concerned, he 'just did deliveries' and it was my problem. Suggest Mow Direct look at who they entrust with their reputation.Ended up borrowing ramps from a neighbour and getting him to help (although even if delivered correctly it is a two-man job to get it off the pallet - something not indicated by MowDirect).Product itself had clearly been thoroughly pre-delivery inspected and tested,but it took a couple of phone calls to actually get it working (calls dealt with efficiently and courteously).Instructions for assembling and fitting the mulch plug were unclear but eventually worked it out (I admit I am not very technically-minded).Product itself is very good and easy to operate.Overall, a good product experience but an uneven customer service one.",GB

A gentleman called me back who claimed the manager took my telephone order and had advised me that they were short in stock . This was a very poor answer because the manager did not take my order because it was a young lady who did. I was never informed there was short supply of stock.

Unfortunately after assembling it, fuelling it, oiling it etc etc according to the instructions, every time you release the 'self propel' handle the spring actioning that mechanism jumped off the hook under the mower so you either have to upend the mower and re-attach it (a right hassle after the roller is in place - we had to enlist a child's hand to fit) or push the mower with all your strength and no self propel help. My husband has botched a fix with string, which is working so far. We couldn't face the hassle of waiting in again for its' collection, returning the now assembled mower complete with oil and petrol, and waiting again for the delivery of another...which would also need assembling.

Eventually the mower turned up on 28 March!! Unpacked it to find the rear left height adjuster lever bent over so was rubbing on the wheel. I straightened that, put the machine together and fired it up. Runs well although the build quality isn't great but it does cut the grass so will have to see how it goes.  One issue for me though is the front wheel drive system as the manufacturer, probably to keep costs down, has designed it with hard plastic wheels and driving from the 2 front wheels just causes them to spin on the grass before it starts to move so you end up with wheel spin marks where there use to be grass. Would I buy another one? Probably not. I just need to save the money up and pay the going rate for a good honda.",GB

Goods arrived in time, good condition. By then I'd already received the first of 2 spam emails from Mowdirect to invite me to revisit their website to purchase the item I'd already purchased. However, when I'd assembled the mower, charged the battery and taken it outside to try it for the first time...Nothing. Didn't work. Rather than phone Mowdirect I went to the web for answers. A simple fix in the end due to an electic cable not being attached inside. In my opinion this should've been checked, tested before dispatch. For these reasons I feel there's been a lack of attention to detail which leaves me neither impressed nor overly disappointed. 3 stars only.",GB

52df97610000640002722c7b,We bought a generator; just as well we didn't need to use it straight away!,22/01/2014,3,"On 3rd January, we chose a Honda 'suitcase' generator and I ordered it from Mowers Direct. I presumed that since it was listed, it would be in stock. A saleswoman from the company rang the next day to say it was not available and suggested another at the same price but with a better output. She suggested that Honda machines attracted a premium. Although it was for its proven reliability that we chose Honda, we agreed - the Chinese Loncin has yet to prove its long term reliability. The machine arrived the next working day - excellent!On reading the handbook, we found that it needed both sump oil and an earth - and neither had been supplied.The oil (10W-30) is not one stocked by garages nor, apparently, is it available from their usual suppliers but I was able to order some from a garden machinery supplier in the next town.I then spoke to a Mowers Direct salesman to point out that, if an earth rod is required before the machine is safe to run, we had an incomplete machine; also that we had only 10W-40 oil to hand - would that do? He rang back to say he had ordered an earth rod to be sent to us (but many ran the generator unearthed) and assured us that 10W-40 oil would do.The earth rod arrived; we have not yet been charged for it - but it had no lug-clamp. In fact, what we really wanted was a means of connecting the generator earthing point to the house earth since this is conveniently just outside the back door.Yesterday, 21st January, I collected our sump oil, bought two metres of earth wire and a jubilee clip and we were at last able to run the generator - it started easily - but it was just as well we were not in real need!Conclusions:1. Essentially, as soon as the generator arrives, it ought to be capable of running and supplying power. Who wants to have to phone around to establish what extra parts are required and then have to go and buy them? The extra expense is not great but the inconvenience is.2. The Mowers Direct salespeople were invariably charming and quick to respond but the advice they gave me is at variance with that of the maker; I am not totally happy with that.3. If sump oi; and an earth rod are needed before the machine can run, why doesn't the maker include them - and an appropriate clamp? The extra expense would not be great.",GB

I pulled and I pulled the starter cord, but to no avail. After 10 minutes I gave up the battle. I had a garden chap doing some rotovating for me, an ex-paratrooper, so quite tough. He tried for several minutes and it started, it spluttered, but did not continue. This happened 3 times and it ticked over very slowly and stopped. He checked the engine and there appeared to be a spring missing. I bought a spring, not the manufacturers one as it probably came from China. He managed to get it going at a sufficient tick over that it didn't cut out. I spent 20 minutes cutting, but not finishing, my lawn as I had to go out. When I returned I tried to start it. No joy. I tried to start it again on Saturday, Sunday and Monday. No joy. I could have sent it back and asked for my money back, but I'm game for a laugh having just chased Homebase for 7 weeks trying to get my kitchen fitted. I contacted Mowdirect who gave me a local dealer who would be able to help me. I phoned and I phoned, but I kept getting an unobtainable tone. I checked BT Phone line which gave the same number. As I say, I'm game for a laugh, so I tried again. No joy. I typed in the industrial estate, on the internet,  where the agent is, supposedly, based. I phoned the company whose address was the one next door. They told me the company was no longer there. I phoned Mowdirect and was informed that they normally contacted the repair company before passing the details onto the customer, me. I pointed out that they obviously didn't in this case. I was given details of another of your agents, in Truro, 30 miles away. I phoned them and confirmed that they were one of your agents, but unfortunately, did not carry out the repairs themselves, but sent them to a chap up the road. It was suggested that I phone the repair man direct. He confirmed that he could take a look at the mower, but he normally invoiced your agent. I phoned Mowdirect and they agreed to pay the repair man if he sent them an invoice. I took the mower to the repair man and left it with him. He phoned me a couple of hours later to inform me that there was no throttle cable. He phoned Mowdirect to let them know, and Mowdirect sent him the throttle cable. He fitted it and I drove back to Truro to pick it up. A total for both trips of approximately 120 miles. I mention this because this relates to about 4 gallons of diesel in my car. I did manage to start it when I got home and finish cutting my grass. However, if I'm honest, and things go the way they normally do where I'm concerned, It's highly likely I will be unable to start it next time I go to use it. Yes, call me a pessimist, but be prepared for a further phone call.",GB

On level 2 , after about 10 yards grass starts to accumulate in    front of the basket.  After about 20 yards the engine protests and the basket and the excess grass have to be removed, a very frequent and time-consuming process.Would the motor have sufficient power to fill a much longer basket?3.  Your booklet gives no information as to:a)  State of grass for levels 1,3,4 and 5b)  Action after scarifying e.g. Water?  Cut as soon as really dry?  Roll or not? Fertilise?c)  Best times of year for scarifyingd)  Frequency of scarifying.  Signs that another treatment would be beneficial.I should be very interested to receive your observations",GB

Goods arrived within 24hrs with courier making contact before delivery. 'What excellent service' I thought. Unwrapped and assembled roller, trailer and aerator all without problems. I then turned my attentions to the de-thatcher. Packaging looked different, as though it had been opened and then re-sealed. Suspicions confirmed when cardboard packaging removed. All plastic bags containing nuts, bolts, brackets etc had been opened. One could clearly see where a human thumb had been used to rip them open. I then checked whether anything was missing and sure enough one bracket missing. Phoned customer support next day and was made to feel as though I was lying. I needed to be very firm, as I was being continually interrupted and had to remind the customer service operative that I was the customer. In my opinion I had been sold shop soiled goods or even a display model. Some of the nylock nuts had already been assembled, as the nylock was clearly threaded. After a rather uncomfortable telephone call I was offered and accepted Â£20 compensation and promised that a bracket would be sent out. I am still waiting for the bracket a week later. Fortunately I can swap a bracket from the aerator, in order to use the de-thatcher, but this should not be necessary.

There was some truth in this, as clearly the Hayter mower box was more appropriate to gentle human handling, with delivery to a retailer.

I did email to advise the Company, mainly to let them know to query the courier and also in case there was degradation in the longer term.I had no response from the Company but I have the email for future reference.",CA
4fcf4e9500006400021f6906,"Mowdirect very good, delivery not so",06/06/2012,3,I ordered and paid for a strimmer on-line and received confirmation and was told delivery would be within one or two days. On day three I rang the office who were very helpful and checked into the situation. I received a call back and was told. the machine had been delivered to a different address two days previously. The delivery driver did not leave a note saying what he/she had done. Unfortunately the recipient cannot walk very well and could not let me know where the machine was. In addition part of my order was not delivered at all. In my view to leave the machine at another address without notifying me is completely unacceptable.,GB
4fcee8e100006400021f5fa3,Good but lacked info about delivery,06/06/2012,3,"The Mower I ordered was what I expected, but the delivery time was longer than most and after placing my order there was little info on delivery time etc. After a few days I did get an email to say it was dispatched but even then it was another 4 days coming.  Took 2 weeks to come. I could have got next day from another company for a very similar price and quality of mower.Unless there was a better delivery service I would not order from this company again.",GB
4fbff07000006400021ea5a3,Delivery good instructions rubbish!,25/05/2012,3,Delivery quick and easy. Instructions were very poor and did not describe  how the mower was presented in the box. The Pics in the manual are rubbish. The mower works well and is easy to use.,GB
4fbfcab000006400021ea33e,good stuff comes in bad package!,25/05/2012,3,"howdy! bought a tanaka 230s strimmer from mowdirect which i found to be the least expensive on the net, it arrived promptly and works an absolute treat easily battering my nettles and docks, it also bashed brambles and some other tough woody shrub type material. my only gripe is with the packaging it was delivered in, it had holes torn in the box, inside which the various component were just rattling around. it looks as though it has just passed through mowdirects hands from japan to me, maybe buy a roll of bubble wrap? other than that no problems at all. happy mowing and regards chris",GB
4fbf84f900006400021e9e11,"Choice, presentation, delivery, Pre-Sales, price, good. Post Sales response slow.",25/05/2012,3,"The carriage company used did not telephone me to tell me an approximate time of day that they may be coming, so I had to go and collect it after they had turned up at my home during the one hour I was out.The mower brand, Mountfield, was described by Mowdirect as'British', (GGP is Italian)'offer affordable quality','... brand leaders Mountfield! Mountfield rotary lawnmowers have earned a reputation for reliability and performance at value for money prices. The new series of roller mowers from Mountfield fulfil these criteria, and more - ', and'A single lever height of cut adjustment, with nine settings, ...'.Having now been able to use my mower for a day I would like to see these unjustifiable claims corrected.The package I collected was a mess inside. One of the lower handle bars, unwisely (and loosely) attached at one end to the main frame but left dangling at the other end, had dug a largish hole in the bottom of the package. Many of the (remaining) small parts were floating around inside, not collated into a bag. The Mountfield instructions were execrable, for example referring to very small, unclear, diagrams that for instance did not show all washers nor what type in each location, and with no directions as to HOW each assembly objective was to be achieved.I do think that Mowdirect should issue multiple special warnings with respect to Mountfield mowers, especially those to be delivered to purchaser's locations.In the case of Mountfield it would appear that inspection by MowDirect of the contents of the package would be highly advisable before shipping on.When I eventually got the missing parts (arriving  direct from Mountfield,  5 days after my advising Mowdirect midday Saturday)  I was actually able to put the mower together without special tools. But I didn't know that I could have. I bought a special (hex star) toolset to put the grass box together because it was not apparent from either the instructions or visual inspection of the  product at that time that the flexible grass holder could clip on i.e. without the need to undo the silly washers, affixed using hex star bolts that hold the shiny bare steel bar in place in the (only relatively) rigid red plastic part of the grass collector.The mower worked, but wouldn't pull itself up any slight incline. It was good exercise, but I couldn't do it every day.After adjusting the roller 'clutch' cable to maximum tension, the mower does now, with less help from me, pull up slight inclines, provided the speed lever is set to Maximum ('4'). This is counter-intuitive and that is why I mention it, for the peace of mind of others buying this (SP505R) mower. (As a result I'm glad I didn't buy the SP555R, which has the same engine but a wider blade, and is therefore presumably also heavier as well as experiencing even more resistance to moving forward, cutting the grass in front of it.)Within 10 minutes of getting the mower working the air filter cover and air filter element fell off.Half an hour later, the air filter cover and air filter element fell off again.Shortly afterwards  I managed to catch the 'handle with numbers' on a branch when the engine was not running and that changed the setting. As warned by the instruction manual, the mower then behaved as if it was damaged, and would not start again that day.It was very difficult to get the red plastic cover off to investigate what I had done to the drive mechanism as both the hex star bolts at the top edge were behind the black bar going across. The right hand one bolt was especially difficult to remove, as that one is angled even more vertically, and in fact I suspect I have not been able to do it up again completely. It appears I will have to remove the horizontal black bar of the handlebar assembly to do this, a non-trivial task owing to the minute separation (leverage moment) of the locations for the pair of what are effectively nuts and bolts each side that almost 'hold' the handlebar in place vertically, of which this black bar is a part.Fortunately, the next day, the mower seemed OK, without me doing anything to the (variable belt tension) mechanism that purports to be a speed change mechanism. I am concerned for the life duration of the belt, which this variable tension mechanism turns inside out and back again on each revolution of the belt.After an hour or so grass started flying out of the top of the grass collector, even though patently nowhere near full. On inspection the flexible part of the grass container, with its bright steel retaining bar, was coming apart from the red plastic (relatively) rigid part of the grass collection removable unit. The bar had worked past both the silly washers that attempt to apply a one-sided only restraint to this bar to hold it in place in its red plastic frame despite the necessary rigidity not being available from this frame. My specially acquired hex star set of tools went to work again. It is probably not a good idea to allow the grass box to fill up as I think it is the weight of the grass that causes the box to come apart.It is useful to be able to change the belt tension using the lever numbered 1 to 4 as one can leave the engine running at max revs, which is what the instructions say is desirable, even when you want to travel slowly and yet not be releasing the roller clutch using its awkward handle.The handlebar rotating black lever-handles (for disassembly) stick out and catch on hedges etc., and the flat plates that move with both the upper and lower black plastic handles (engine cut-out on top and roller clutch underneath) seem also designed to catch on any vegetation it brushes up against and rip it off.The (thankfully) single lever height adjustment allows, not the 9 different levels of the Mountfield blurb, nor the 8 different levels of the Mowdirect blurb, but in fact 7 different cutting levels. With the wet weather we've had, this has not yet proven a serious problem for me, being still at the stage of bringing the grass length down as it had not been mown for 2 or 3 weeks, although even so a finer gradation (i.e. as expected) would have been useful and desirable.Ergonomically, the horizontal control handles at the top could be better. Unlike other self- propelled mowers which I have owned, one cannot cause this mower to start to pull itself forward by pressing your belly up against the lower (roller clutch) handle. Being made of rubber externally, it won't slide (upwards) against you to engage the roller clutch. And the angle of this handle is toward you, rather than slightly upward, which also makes it awkward to acquire from standstill. And it rests too far from the frame, requiring ideally larger hands than I have (average) to pull it up from the static handle.This is the first Honda engine I have owned. It still starts, even after having been used the day before. So far then, a blade brake is not missed.The front slot-type retainer for the starter string is not worth assembling. Much better to not use this and not install it, which will I hope make the handlebar much more stable and stay in place vertically. The benefit of this string being further away from hedges outweighs for me any benefit from keeping it slightly more out of the way of the grass box when lifting that vertically through the handlebars, which is not something I found I wanted to do with a heavy grass box when filled. The starter string rubs against the handlebars on starting. So far this has not removed the paint of the handlebars, but I would expect this to be only a matter of time.I'd prefer that Mountfield had not mounted their large front logo at 20 degrees off 'horizontal'. It doesn't look 'hip' or 'Italian-style'. It just looks as if they couldn't be bothered to align their logo properly, and that no-one checked, or possibly that whoever did check (if anyone checks anything at Mountfield), thought 'what the hell'.Having said all this, the Mountfield SP505R, with its bright metallic die-cast chassis and red plastic bits - with the notable exceptions of the badge as mentioned above, and possibly the black rubbery semi-handles for rear roller clutch and engine- enable and the flat metallic bits on the side parts of these handles - is a mower that appears pretty, even sassy. But then, so do some women who prove a disappointment on further acquaintance.",GB
