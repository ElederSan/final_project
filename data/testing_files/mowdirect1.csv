65ae3abee0553e01f9c3d3a1,Started well then hopeless,12/01/2024,1,"I saw a recon Racing mower advertised that met my needs and initially was impressed by the ""helpful"" responses to queries, and made a purchase with 4 figure c/c payment with some queries pending.Among other problems:Was told it could only go on the flat and there were no manufacturers guides as to slope.  Suggested I'd be better buying other mowers (, more expensive)Found download of user manual which specified operational slopes which were fine !!  Just a lie to up price of purchase or ignorance ??Tried to get a manual download from them that they said would do, but failedArrived on delivery date and their man was unable to start it.  Supposed to have been reconditioned and checked before delivery !!!! was returned.Failed to get responses to what the problem was,Advised to mow across the slope to overcome (non existent) slope problem - unsafe and contrary to manual instructions.Lost patience and arranged a refund to be made promptly before my card payment fell due - all agreed, but no refund was triggered so money was taken .Money was returned after further demands and phoning.Sad ,- on the face of it mowdirect should be a good port of call but my experience says avoid - especially for machines that do not provide a service back up or even basic data to allow yiu to maintain yourself.",GB
65a66c6bc190cee2d2b2cda5,absolute rubbish back up when things go…,04/01/2024,1,"absolute rubbish back up when things go wrong, at well into 4 figures I purchased a racing sit on mower, after a hand full of uses and well within the warrenty period, it stopped as if it had no fuel in it. Our gardener tried all the basics, but it appeared as if it was an electrical issue. Phoned mow direct only to get fobbed off with they will call me back. But never did call back.Every time I call it another excuse fob off or something different.Now after endless fob off emails, the latest they want me to pay them £150 to collect it, take it and depending on what they find I might, just might get my £150 back.In my opinion I would have had better after sales service had i bought a used one for a fraction of the money in an auction.",GB

The ordering process was hassle-free and my purchase was delivered promptly. But I did have one major gripe; the Feider was described in MowDirect’s website as having a minimum cutting height of 20mm and it was this claim that made me pick this model. But on its delivery, I find that the actual minimum cutting height is 24.5mm. It doesn’t sound much of a difference, but it is!",GB

As for the collecting box...it collects about 1/5 of what it cuts. I still had to use a grass rake and collect by hand..totally pointless.One of the bolts came undone even after tightening ( & yes they were very tight!) and I've now lost a nut on the lawn so until I get a new one I can't use the mower.Wished I'd stuck with an electric one tbhMower Direct were fine..easy enough to purchase and quick delivery.

62aa761a787382efe20de482,An adequate small lawnmower,16/06/2022,3,"An adequate small lawnmower. I have been using it on relatively long grass which it copes with well, but, as you would expect, the grass collector fills quickly. Not a problem in itself, but as with many small engines it starts well from cold and from fully warmed up. Much more difficult to start when in between and it is in this condition most of the time when frequently stopping to empty grass.Easy to assemble. When using I noticed one of the nuts holding the starter assembly on top of the engine was visibly loose. It is worth checking the tightness of all nuts/bolts before use, not just those which the purchaser is responsible for.It is sold as having a 99cc engine, I had some misgivings about this when purchasing. However, the badge on Mower states 139cc. Looking again at the website I notice that one of the pictures shows a visibly smaller motor. Perhaps the spec. has changed. I probably should not have gone back to the website to check the engine spec advertised - the price has been reduced by £30 in the two weeks since I bought mine!",GB

I managed to speak to someone who said they will send me a new fuel tank that I can fit myself. I was not very happy with this at all.  After another week still had no new fuel tank and no emails from the company.  Throughly annoyed. That was until I received an email from Sally Anne asking me how I found Mow Direct and I told her my problems.  Sally had this sorted and a new mower delivered within 3 days. She is the only saving grace to this company and she deserves a huge pay rise as I don’t think they would get anymore business if it want for her.  I would use them again even after my bad first experience as I know of there were any more problems Sally Anne would be to here to sort it out.  Many thanks Sally,GB

While I charged the battery I had to saw the pallet I various places to remove it from the mower, took about an hour and shouldn't have been necessary.I think the issue was that the gear stick needs a wiggle to assert neutral before the starter motor turns. With the battery charged with the supplied charger (very helpful) and added petrol - a bit of practice with the controls, and all good.

Not sure how robust it is?Certainly the length of the handles, with just two screws holding them in place, (with plastic threads on the wing nuts, suggest future problems and gaffer tape)!The plastic ‘hub caps’ fall off. Not sure if this matters?  But more important, the plastic cover over the air filter seems to get rather wet/oil/petrol if you do a few starts and stops. This makes the plastic clip shut mechanism insecure and cover falls off. However two thick rubber bands seem to have fixed this.Would be nice if the cutting area was slightly wider than the wheels, so that edges of paths could be done … without putting strain on those long, rather flex-able handles.Motor is one speed and seems to cope well enough and is good at mulching dry grass.

Sales team was professional, delivery was prompt and well communicated, and a minor cosmetic issue with the product on delivery was swiftly resolved. However, aftercare was woefully inadequate, passing the fault around from department to department. There was a long delay going to and fro with their prefered warranty support provider before, eventually and after a delay of around a month during the peak of the growing season this year, a local specialist was appointed. Of course after being collected for a qualified service engineer to adjust things, everything now appears to be fixed. Of course, with the long hot spell, there has not been much opportunity to test things out!My recommendation is therefore - for products where aftersales support is unlikely to be necessary, or of a trivial nature, this is company offers an excellent service and a great price. For more complex major purchases, it really is worth spending the extra 10% or so to make your purchase with a local supplier.",GB

I was given a delivery date by the courier who on the day called me to say that the box which the mower was in had split open and the contents where all over the back of his lorry and it looked like some parts had been damaged he suggested that he return it to the Mow Direct and that I should contact them.  I tried to telephone them later that day but no one was answering the calls and the website was not working.  I left a number of messages asking someone to contact me but never received a call.  Then approx. 1 week later I got an email to say that the courier would be delivering a lawn mower the following day (lucky for me my neighbours were at home to take the delivery as I could not get time off work at such short notice).  Mower has now been delivered and I will be putting it together this weekend (hope all parts are in the box).  So although there was a lack of communication by the Company I have in fact received the mower all be it 16 days after ordering,GB

Good information and advice was given on suitable machinery.The company does not seem to control the end to end process i.e. sub contracts delivery. Web site said 3 to 5 days delivery time but had to contact company after 3 to clarify when it would come. Delivery company indicated a date that was working 7 days after order.This was ok for me bit did not match original expectation. Asked delivery company what time of day it was likely. They stated sometime in the morning, it actually arrived at 6.15pm. I had taken a day off work to receive it so not too pleased. The delivery process was shocking. Only one man on vehicle struggling to get heavy pallet onto tail lift. Accident waiting to happen. In the end took myself and a neighbour to help man handle the pallet. Design of pallet for this mower was rubbish.It took 20 minutes to drag it on to my drive and another 40 to cut/smash bits of pallet to get mower off. Expected a trailer and tow bar to come as well but these were not on the lorry. I contacted customer servicesby email  to be told these were out of stock. Not sure why I was not told this until I chased up.I found it irritating that Mow Direct were chasing for a review/feedback before the mower had been delivered.The mower itself is fantastic, could not be more pleased.",GB

I looked at the website the next day to find that the order had not been processed.I contacted customer services and they informed me that the item was out of stock and that they did not have a date when they could say it would be back in stock. The very well informed lady then offered me an alternative which was a Mitox 26L-a Select brushcutter, which she said was in stock and the closest match to my original order (and was £30 cheaper).I agreed to this change, and was told I would have it delivered on Friday (it being late on Wednesday afternoon at the time). On Thursday afternoon I looked again at the website and noticed that the order again was not showing any advance beyond the initial order status, so I again contacted customer services, only to be told that due to an end of month activity the order for some unknown reason had been missed being uploaded on to the system and that I would not get it on Friday! I must say that he apologised and said that I could cancel the order or otherwise I would definitely have it on Monday. I was not best pleased, but decided that Monday it would have to be.The Mitox 26L-a duly was delivered on Monday and I have to say it is a very good machine and I have put it to work on some very tough areas using both the metal blade and the nylon cord, it works a treat, so very pleased with the purchase, but very frustrated with the order process.My advice to any future buyers is to check your order status regularly and definitely before the 2PM cut-off on at least the day before you expect delivery to hopefully avoid disappointment. Also Mowdirect should have a process that if an item is out of stock to say so before an order is accepted.",GB

This isn't rocket science, if you make a commitment to a customer and find you can't deliver on it then COMMUNICATE AND EXPLAIN, don't just keep your head down!  One final point, we're talking here about a large ride-on mower and came wonderfully and securely packaged but I suspect no thought is given to how the customer was going to get it off the pallet. Securing it on the pallet while providing a means for the customer to get it off without having to recruit a couple of hefty neighbours would be helpful.",GB

Due to the bank holiday the order did get delayed somewhat and when the machine was delivered, it came on too small a truck so the lawn tractor wouldn't fit on the tail lift.  Through a bit of assisted man handling we managed to get it off but wasn't great. Although advertised as 'ready to do' I discovered that a battery was not fitted and so the machine couldn't be used, it was also quite dirty including across the seat and appeared to have been left out in a rain shower or had been splashed through a large puddle. Phoned up and a battery was sent via courier for next day. All in all the staff I spoke to were friendly and helpful but it wasn't a seamless experience.",GB

Ah, we don't have anymore stock till next year, (grass still growing) but you can pick another model as we will allow a credit against it . So, having picked another mower (a Lawnflight) and having to spend another £90.00 to get it, I ordered it.Upon delivery I ""unboxed and built it up"" to find that on putting fuel in the fuel tank it was coming out the side of the tank almost as quick as it was going in! Contacted Mowdirect (grass still growing) ""no problem, we can replace it or send a replacement part"". As the mower was built and the part would be sent asap (2-3 days) I decided on the new part to be sent.Some time later, I decided that it would be a good idea to ""charge"" the battery on the new replacement mower (electric start). On ""un-packing"" the charger I found that one of the electrical pins on the ""plug socket"" was broken. Again contacted Mowdirect, ""no problem, we will send a replacement"" (do you see a pattern here?) .At present I am waiting for the replacement parts to arrive hopefully today as the grass still growing!Whilst I accept that all these faults were not of Mowdirect's direct making and that they have tried to resolve the problems (3) asap. I have had to spend an extra £90.00 I did not intend to spend, had a lot of my time wasted, building, draining, stripping, re-packing, building mowers and the grass is still growing.So, I would suggest that Mowdirect contact their manufacturers, as they will cost them customers in the long run with their poor products.

No, the flimsy guard has caught in the belt and forced it off the pulleys; well you’ve probably driven over a twig or such like.When you pay the extortionate bill which includes £60 per hour labour and get the machine back, you can still not mow the grass because the grass chute keeps blocking.Their first thought (Excuse no.3 in the handbook) is they didn’t clear the chute because it smelt of ammonia and the technician thought the might be animal waste matter in it.The chute wasn’t even blocked when you sent it in.  It turns out their £60 per hour technician put the machine back together wrong, the grass chute has been assembled incorrectly and the grass trimming have now packed all the area under the seat and around the axel  and because there isn’t a clear flow to the grass box, that’s why it keeps blocking.You then have to spend two hours fixing their error, cleaning out the grass from areas of the mower it should’t be and assembling the chute correctly.To give a balanced review, the lady in the customer services department was helpful at this stage, she did quickly resolve my error code issue.  After putting the mower back together it wouldn’t start and flashed up error code 06.  The error code was cause by me disassembling and then reassembling the grass chute, and I was instructed how to clear it.I’ve waited three days now to give MowDirect the opportunity to apologise but nothing, hence this review.",GB

596abbadfba87f08f41df25c,My 20-year-old Countax suffered a …,16/07/2017,3,"My 20-year-old Countax suffered a gearbox failure last autumn and so I decided to replace this year but with a smaller machine without a grassbox to make storage easier during winter. I spent a long time looking online and was amazed to see every retailer charged exactly the same for each machine. I wouldn't say there is a cartel in operation exactly but maybe the manufacturers refuse to let retailers discount their machines but it was all very odd.I ordered a Lawnflite 380 GT-X-2-in-1 lawn tractor and gave specific instructions about delivery. We live in an undulating area of East Sussex and our drive is just 3m wide and very steep so I specifically asked for a 71/2 tonne lorry to deliver it as they are only 2.5m wide and would get up the drive. I also asked for it to be delivered as late as possible as my son might be able to help after work.So I was a bit surprised to have the delivery driver arrive at 10.40 am in a 20-tonne truck. He said the pallet for the tractor was too big to go in a 71/2 tonne truck and Mow Direct should know this. He was all for dropping the pallet on the tarmac apron at the bottom of our drive but said we could try pushing it up the drive on a jack, which we did manage but it rather knackered me as I'm over 70 and not long out of hospital.I then had to remove the tractor from the pallet and eventually worked out that the only way was to jack up the rear and saw the cross members of the pallet away and then push the tractor out of the pallet frame.After adding fuel, the tractor started and worked reasonably well although it would not cut through thistles and ragwort, I drove over them and they bounced up again behind me.I wanted some advice about the mulching kit and rang MowDirect but was told the tractor expert was off that day and would ring me back next day. I am still waiting five days later for his call........My other gripe is that the instruction manual is pathetic. It may be written in 15 languages but the few line drawings and minimal text  don't inspire confidence. The Countax book gave a good explanation of every area of operation and working tolerances. I know this is not MowDirect's fault but something they could take up with the manufacturer.Finally, when I was ringing around trying to get a discount one of the retailers said a £1,500 tractor was OK if you are prepared to throw it away after seven years and buy a new one whereas a £5,000-£6,000 tractor will still be good for many years after the same time and worth about £2,000 if you wanted to trade it in for a new one. So you pay your money and make your choice.",GB

This was agreed and then they tried to charge me for delivery, which as per your website is already FOC. I sent them an email of this advert and yet they still insisted this was chargeable.

To my surprise they turned up at 11am and refused to admit the delivery should have been after 12.30. (even though I had an email) So I told them to leave it on my drive. 15 minutes later I was called again and they told me they could not leave it without a signature. As I was at work this was impossible, so my neighbour had to sign. The Mower was delivered on a Pallet, which I must say was not fun to unpack by myself. And also I was shown nothing about its functionality as the delivery driver had left.  And then to my surprise, NO TOW BAR that I was promised. This was posted to me at a later date.

My previous Hayter, bought from MowDirect had served me well for about 9 years.On opening the packaging I saw that the handlebar securing knob was shattered. Phoned MowDirect immediately with a very apologetic and helpful response to put a replacement in the post. On assembly of the mower it was obvious that whole handlebar was out of alignment. Again an apologetic response and agreement to collect the mower and send replacement next day.On arrival it was clear that the original mower had not been sent in original packaging as the new mower arrived in original well packaged Hayter logo box. Previous mower was sent in plain cardboard box with bits of cardboard packed around the mower.Wrote to MowDirect with explanation that original box was wet and therefore repackaged.Disappointed with receiving damaged goods. Will never now if damaged in transit or if mower was 'shop soiled'. But, after care was polite, efficient and hassle free, arriving only one day later than original order.

57c919eb0000ff000982e227,MowDirect - let down by either end of the process,02/09/2016,3,"Make no mistake, MowDirect is a good company; helpful Customer Service staff and, as I cover later, necessary excellent Technical staff. Plus, their prices are there or thereabouts.I have bought a brushcutter, mower, hedge trimmer and shredder/chipper from them in the past few weeks, so I have a comprehensive experience to draw on.But MowDirect are typical of many online retailers where once the sale is complete, problems can occur.The Tanaka brushcutter I bought is my main gripe; the instructions that came with it are criminally unclear and inadequate. I ended up having to strip the machine and be 'talked through' the assembly process by Kevin (Technical Dept at MowDirect) who was excellent and should be given a pay rise. A university degree in Mechanical Engineering is desirable if you buy a Tanaka brushcutter.I complained to MowDirect about the instructions but they said Tanaka won't update them because 'they'd printed so many' (YouTube, PDFs?). Sorry MowDirect but you need to use your clout as the 'UK's largest garden machinery supplier' and make Tanaka improve their assembly instructions; a brushcutter is a potentially lethal machine and other reviews have complained about them so come on, MowDirect.Delivery; generally fine but again, like online retailers, a 3rd party company is used for this part of the process (which is still part of the 'service').One delivery failed to arrive on the agreed day with no forewarning from either MowDirect or XPD (the outsourced delivery firm). I had to chase but XPD rarely answer their phones. Phoning MowDirect, they implied XPD can be 'a bit hit or miss'. Not good enough and unprofessional to 'dis' a contracted supplier.The delivery arrived the next day but thereafter I was still receiving emails from XPD giving me delivery dates for products I'd already received. Bonkers.In summary MowDirect is a good company that is let down by ragged bits at either end of the process.",GB

The brush cutter would still be delivered next day should I wish? I advised that Friday was preferable to the Thursday and we agreed a delivery for that Friday. I waited in all day and made a phonecall at 1645hrs to enquire when the brush cutter would be arriving? Next Tuesday was the answer, no explanation why, even though I asked. Did I still want it? Yes. So after putting customers off for the Friday for no delivery I've also wasted a couple of hours Tuesday waiting for delivery and in the meantime had to hire a brush cutter for a couple of days.

This delayed delivery but on appointed day courier TPH arrived not in a 7.5 ton but a 18ton vehicle which was too large to leave main road some 200 mtrs from house. It took over an hour to unload item and get it to our house.  I was knackered. Would I use this company again, not unless they sort out their sub-contractors.",GB
57966ae20000ff00097444b6,Satisfied with product BUT-----,25/07/2016,3,"Disappointed that despite free delivery claim, noted that £10.00 immediately added for packaging or suchlike. ( Was refunded upon request, but should should not have been charged AND I should not be 'out of pocket' whilst awaiting a credit card refund process. Further disappointed that delivery could not be arranged for our island address despite a toll-free bridge being the trunk road link for many years now. Final disappointment in that despite claim that if order received before 9.00 it would be  dispatched immediately BUT in the event the courier used by Mow Direct retained the delivery for 12 hours before submitting it to the supplementary delivery company that we were obliged to engaged. Shameful that Mow Direct accepted our order and debited our credit card BEFORE  making contact to advise they couldn't provide the free delivery. Order made evening of 13th delivery received from our courier on 22nd (they had not received it until minutes before 6.00 on 20th).Mow Direct were very polite in handling the matter and in essence the failure was with their nominated courier. Despite all this the product is VERY GOOD DEAL and I would highly recommend it.",GB

I phoned MowDirect who were very helpful and said that this could be done.My mower was delivered on a TUESDAY, left in the garage with no one signing for it.I don't know if this was the courier or MowDirect that didn't get it right.",GB
578feb0d0000ff000972af44,Okay product but delivery not as advertised,20/07/2016,3,"Product is fine and works as intended but it arrived a day late meaning a job was missed. Paid a bit more for it from Mow Direct than other places because of next day delivery which didn't happen. Was then given the usual ecommerce excuse for this type of issue which is ""we are working to integrate our systems to ensure that the supply chain works better"". Shame really and doesn't reflect well. In the end their system integrations are not my issue and so shouldn't be given as a justifiable reason.",GB
578e54880000ff0009723110,Mower drekkly,19/07/2016,3,"Ordered mower on Monday and as I live in cornwall expected maybe a day extra for delivery, however received email to say 3 hour delivery slot for Thursday so hung around to take delivery....nothing arrived and no email from courirer to clarify. Recieved updated delivery slot for Friday...no sign of mower after waiting in...finaly arrived Saturday morning when I was out, however my partner was home so signed for it and although box was damaged mower appears ok. Courier was helpful and coureous but bottom line delivery was 3 days later than expected with no explanation other than the courier did not turn up. I doubt this is uncommon. So my experience thus far with mower direct is not so good and definately not direct...more like drekkly as we say in Cornwall!",GB
578e44c90000ff00097229dc,Goods not received,19/07/2016,3,"We ordered three items, the battery operated mower eventually came and its great! The other two items we ordered are still not here..! Its been over a month and when you ring the woman does not remember to ring you back to tell you where you outstanding order is. Then they tell you they thought the order was fulfilled but they take your money anyway!",GB
578ca2820000ff0009719af5,Overall good service,18/07/2016,3,I would have given five stars as the product is fine and communications were good. One star lost for poor quality instructions which are hard to follow. Second star lost for failure to advise me of missing part in delivery ( mulch plug out of stock ). Don't let this put you off. Just be aware that they aren't perfect.,GB
