65b115680916f543b1a389a3,Bad experience with marketplace seller,05/01/2024,2,"Unfortunately I had a bad experience which, on the one hand, was the seller's problem, on the other hand I see that Amazon is responsible because, apparently, they let anyone sell on their marketplace. I had an order for a tablet, which not only took almost 3 weeks to arrive, but also came with the wrong specifications. Amazon support said I should resolve it directly with the seller and the seller simply doesn't respond.",US
65afdb177d8134ffaae6549a,I always buy products from Amazon,01/01/2024,1,"I always buy products from Amazon, BUT if there's a delay they usually don't update the shipping unless the carrier sends a email or txt to update when it's coming. And some of the customer service people are not helpful sometimes are they for real? And also the welfare program, most customers have snap cash ebt, but Amazon accepts food stamps ebt, why can't they accept both? It makes it much harder for customers who only have cash ebt to buy food especially if they have children.",US

I tried reaching out to the new Amazon medical just to ask if they work with the Veteran's Administration. The chat line “ended” the chat before I even got the question out. I tried the chat a dozen times with 0 results. It’s obvious that Amazon doesn’t need our correspondence as we still buy thier products.,US

Also I've ordered a product and received something completely different of a lower price. Once I got charge for trainers without receiving a £50 refund. I've given a bad review to the seller and I got the following: We could not post your review because it focuses on one or more of these topics:SellersDeliveryPackagingPricingAvailabilitySo check the reviews very thoroughly when buying on Amazon these days - usually they refer to other products that have nothing to do with what you're buying.I'm sorry as I used to like this service",GB
65b252c6dbd119ab2c125594,Well,25/01/2024,4,"Well, y'all lot know what it is. It is the one-stop shop for pretty much everything innit?I am not here to talk about that tho. I am here to talk about the convenience factor that it has created in our lives. It is literally through the roof.I mean, you literally think of someting, ""amazon it"" (I use the term like ""google it"" here) and it can be at your doorstep threshold or in your hand in a matter of days. Selection is massive, options are endless across every sector or industry. Household appliances, consumer electronics, books, clothes, groceries, space crafts and asteroids.. well maybe not that far-fetched, yet.amazon prime's perks are pretty sweet as well, free shipping here, fast shipping there, access to prime video with a large inventory of tv shows, movies and series, prime music included.but the real deal where amazon puts itself forward is the customer service. whenever you have an issue with the product quality, how the seller has treated you, late delivery, or anything of the sorts, they've got your back, bruv.It is all about convenience, variety, reliability and customer satisfaction with these guys. I think they are definitely on the right path and they will be one of the milestone companies that will shape the future for the next generations to come.",DE

Order confirmation email dates Saturday delivery, however my orders in the account shows being delivered on Friday when I won't be in.  Contacted chat, they say they only have an option for Friday, that the date you can select is just an estimate, but when I state I had the option to select a specific day they say oh maybe it will come on Saturday it doesn't show as shipped yet.

I understand the rush after black Friday and before Christmas, but 2 months is outrageous. Even though 2 months have passed I still have no information about when the shipment will be dispatched and when I can expect delivery. I am extremely angry with the lack of communication from Amazon's side, and neglecting of my order. Will initiate all procedures to secure my legally granted consumer rights.",HR

65afa2bd53252a2ca4da1b1f,Amazon CS is lately a complete mess,23/01/2024,1,"Amazon CS is lately a complete mess. So much so, that I've actually stopped using Amazon. When you have an issue, an agent (on the chat) tells you that they'll take ownership, but it's always a lie. Each and every time you send another email, following-up on the case, you get a template-based answer from a different agent, mostly filled with empty words, and little substance. On several occasions, they've sent me contradicting or incorrect information about delivery dates or deadlines for certain actions. When they give you false information, they don't take any responsibility for it, nor do they ever provide the official complaint form, as they should do as per EU legislation. My time is worth more than the discounts or variety of products they may offer. It's just not worth it.",EE

When I did try calling UPS and said I was calling about a Amazon pick up, they hung up on me 3 times. What is going on with Amazon? Are they on their way  out? It sure does sound like it.

65af491d758e3c43c76a0d14,Amazon Deceptive Discount Policy,22/01/2024,1,"Amazon offered what they call a, ""Lightning Discount"", to an item in my cart. The discount was for $81.When I went to check-out, the discount was taken away. I spoke with a supervisor at costumer service, who told me that those discounts last for 15 minutes. To me, that's ridiculous. Especially for a 5 year Prime member, who's spent thousands with Amazon. I learned this after a 2 hour long run-around with customer service. The supervisor refused to re-honor their discount. I'm paying $100 more than Amazon's regular price with one of their competitors. The competitor is honest, and a human being.Amazon's discount policy, in this case, is deceptive. Beware",US

There will be the XYZ company or the Lovemore company or what ever the name is but when you look at each item by different companies they are all the same sales page. Its like there is an uncle who produces the product and six kids and cousins who create a company and sell the products. Sometimes the prices are different or the ship time but its still the same product.Problem is it wastes your shopping time.

The only issue I have is my card was replaced while in a trial of prime that was 1.99. When I went to update it, they didn't even let me finish my week of prime (I was only 3 days in) and they charged me 14.99 right away. So I paid 16.99 for a month in reality and customer service said because I used it. (Um like people do with a PAID trial) I was just basically out of that money. So I'll order again but never will I ever use prime again.",US

Prices are not always very competitive though. What really sucks is the customer services. Everything is standardized. No room for a personal touch.

I recently ordered three cases of copy paper at the same time, same order--one came one day, a second came the next, and the third never came and Amazon told me it had been returned. How can three packages, ordered at one time, each find a different path (or not) to the purchaser? With other order, packages have been dropped off at neighbor's houses and then shown on the Amazon website as being 'delivered'. Clearly Amazon should not be in the shipping business.And for the privilege of this Amazon ""service"" the company has increased its membership fees substantially.I am frankly looking at alternate suppliers.",US

I wondered at the time of Amazon was trying to protect customers or the businesses that are selling on Amazon.

Previously, it was like everything I purchased was coming late. Today, I get a message that my package will be late. Please, let's not start this cycle again. I'm leaving a review based on the company itself. I would like to make a suggestion. When, a Primes member orders items within a certain time frame to have them delivered by a certain day, that's what we expect. Some of us are business owners, work from home, and have projects to complete. Paying for a service just to receive items late is a mute point. Here's my suggestion. For every order a prime member does not receive by the correct time frame indicated, you refund half the purchase price or give a $15 Amazon credit automatically. This means prime members should not have to call in and request this credit. You should have a designated team who keeps track of shipping to ensure orders will be delivered on time and when they are not, you credit the prime membes' account and send the notification of received our items late. How does that sound. Because $5 isn't enough. Truth be told $15 isn't either. However, it's more that $5.",US

It was supposed to be delivered on 6th June 2023.I received an delivery confirmation on email. It stated the parcel had been delivered at reception. This is somewhat suspect because there is no reception area or anywhere safe to leave it, except with a neighbour. It wasn’t left with one of them.I enquired about this on Amazon chat. To be told the delivery status was updated too early. Strange… Apologies were given and the new delivery date was 8th of June 2023.Surprise, surprise…the parcel still didn’t arrive on 8th June.I called Amazon customer service and informed them about this. The customer advisor stated they need to speak to their manager. I explained they are in breach of contract the goods never arrived and funds have been taken. I asked for a full refund.To be fair, after the advisor had spoke to their boss. They stated I would have a refund in up to 5 working days. They also told me I could keep the items if they arrived. Of course, the items never arrived.I received a confirmation email of my refund being processed. Thankfully, I received a full refund including the postage and packaging I paid for too.Despite the initial frustration to start with, I’m happy I got a hassle free refund experience.

This has always been an issue and has nothing to do with fraud.There is also a new issue with returns: once an item has been returned and it has arrived at the warehouse you would previously receive an automatic email confirming receipt and that the refund process has been started and the funds will be in your account within a specific time frame. This is not happening now so you have no idea if it has even arrived let alone when your refund will arrive.The underlying issue is that Amazon have no procedure for lodging a complaint in writing.",GB

So, rather than get a refund, I ordered a replacement on 9/2/23. The package was supposed to arrive in two to three days. I am still waiting for the item. It is now almost 9/18. I am a Prime customer, and have spent quite a lot of money with them over the years. I've called their customer service numerous times. I keep getting the same scripted answers. Sounds like a run-around to me. The item is in transit, they keep repeating. When I checked the USPS tracking history, the last date is 14 days ago, on 9/4/23, stating awaiting receipt of item. In other words, the Post Office hasn't even received the package. Even Amazon's own website says the package may be lost, and to request a refund or replacement. I was told to call back on 9/20 for them to investigate further. That's 18 days since I ordered the item. What a joke. I barely can understand these reps over the phone. Sound familiar? This is the last time I will ever order a big-ticket item from them. Before, Amazon promptly refunded me or sent out a replacement right away. This is how you lose loyal customers!Post Script (9/26/23): I was finally issued a refund,18 days after I purchased the watch. The item never arrived, nor did the USPS ever receive my package. I got an email from their customer service saying that the package was deemed 'not deliverable' and sent back to an Amazon facility. Just what I was telling them all along. As a Prime customer, I should not have to wait nearly three weeks. Amazon could have sent me a replacement. Again, this is not a good way to treat their loyal customers.",US
640e41abd35c1066e9077e0b,I've been a monthly customer of Amazon…,06/03/2023,3,"I've been a monthly customer of Amazon for years and have 2 primary complaints about the online shopping service. 1)I gave fare/honest reviews of merch I purchased - mostly an adequate rating, a few bad and a few excellent reviews - but Amazon removed my ability to review for a couple years now without adequate explanation. I feel duty bound to warn other customers about items I've purchased that are advertized fraudulently or defective, which Amazon does not allow me to do. I expect Amazon as a middleman service suffers from conflict of interest when it comes to the various companies for which they brokers, so it censors reviews for the businesses it's too close to, in order to protect its sells. This is siding with these companies that sell substandard merchandise against Amazon members, and should immediately stop. Ever paying Amazon shopper should have an unhindered right to review the items they paid for.2) Amazon listings needs to clarify differences in sizing scale when merch is manufactured in different countries, which it most often fails to do. For example, I cannot tell you number of times I purchased items manufactured in China, according to Chinese sizing scale - which is about 2-sizes smaller than US sizing - without being warned by Amazon. The result being, merchandise That doesn't fit - clothes, backpack, laptop case - I either haveto go through headache of returning, just givaway, or trash.",US

While I can't deny the consistently good quality of their products and services, I can't overlook the growing trend of additional charges for certain features. It has left me feeling moderately satisfied with my overall experience.One aspect that has always stood out for me is the impressive range of products available on Amazon. Whether I'm looking for electronics, home goods, or even niche items, I can usually find what I need. The quality of the products I've purchased has generally been reliable, and I appreciate the convenience of having everything delivered right to my doorstep.However, my contentment has been somewhat dampened by the increasing number of features that come at an extra cost. Previously, I enjoyed the simplicity of a Prime membership, which included fast shipping and access to a decent selection of movies, TV shows, and books. Unfortunately, it seems like more and more perks are being pulled behind additional paywalls, which can be frustrating.For instance, the introduction of Amazon Prime Video Channels, which require separate subscriptions for certain content providers, has made the streaming experience less appealing. It feels like I'm being nickel-and-dimed for every additional service, making it harder to justify the extra expenses.",DE

Why does it take about 5 minutes (not exaggerating) to drill down, answer questions, meet criteria and generally jump through hoops in order to get to the point where you can ask a question of a customer service rep?I get that its HUGE but does that exonerate them from basic business practices and being available to their customers?  Is it impossible to imagine that there are some questions that can't be answered by the options they offer up in a list?The COVID pandemic wreaked havoc upon society worldwide and created new standards and expectations for and about work, workers, customers, customer services, etc. and during that time it was impossible to fulfill Prime membership benefits like 2-day shipping, but it's long since and they've not yet reinstated the 2-day shipping policy.Go to amazon and look up prime membership benefits and the list includes video and kindle and music benefits but, all of those come with a monthly subscription fee separate from the $139 annual fee for Prime membership.The shipping benefits listed for Prime Membership reflect two-day shipping on ""select"" items, so perhaps just the ""select"" item list got pared back during COVID and has never been 're-augmented'?Whatever the answer, I'm not sure Amazon prime membership is worth it anymore - certainly not if you're paying for it monthly; but perhaps even the annual membership doesn't make sense?It's rare that I need anything the next day or even two-days later and I'll frequently select delivery on my amazon delivery day, but when I do need something within' two-days, I'm finding Walmart to be more receptive to those needs (and they often deliver the next day AND on Sundays).Me thinks Amazon has gotten too big for it's britches and forgets the trail-blazing they once did only to foist buggy service upon us now.And don't get me started on dropping Amazon returns at a Whole Foods, especially one in NYC  The Upper East Side Whole Foods at 87th & 3rd has a huge Amazon Returns sign with that big smiley swoosh beneath it, so you know you're in the right place, but there's no additional signage to tell you to go to the Mezzanine which is accessible only by elevator (don't take the escalator bc it bypasses the Mezz altogether).",US

Then day after day I annoyed the hell out of them. I wrote them multiple times a day while complaining. I contacted the delivery company which is in my eyes partly responsible. They ignored me for whole 7 days. I also did contact the manufacturer but Amazon still didn't really feel the pressure. So I decided to annoy again and again and again and again until I had another idea. Let's just directly mail Andy Jassy the ceo of Amazon which I did next. I did mention that in the customer support chat and 10 seconds later I got reconnected to someone from problem prevention or something like that and then I explained to them everything again and then 15 min later I'm not even joking they organized a replacement order just like that. Finally!!!!!? But I have really mixed feelings about all the hassle you have to go through first until you mention Andy Jassy and suddenly everything goes really fast. Don't know how to feel about that hence the 3 stars. You should be like that without that I feel I have to pressure Amazon in such a way and annoy them until something is happening.

622559ed445f5107dcaa0f77,So I’ve been ordering from Amazon for…,07/03/2022,3,So I’ve been ordering from Amazon for years and when they say your package is arriving or it’s going to be delivered then that’s what it is. So today 3/6/22 is the first day that Amazon’s employee lied. I had a package that was suppose to be delivered today and it gave the estimated time frame. For me to get a notification stating that it was delivered and I received nothing is confusing. Then I go to the Amazon app and it says that they handed to the resident (ME). So now I’m really confused because how did you hand it to me and I’m not home. Nobody is home and I have a ring camera and I have no footage of anyone delivering anything. So now I’m very very skeptical of ordering anything from this company again. If you have workers lying saying they delivered it and they handed it to the purchaser and didn’t that’s very bad business. Like where in the heck is my package? Amazon this is the last time you’re gonna get my money.,US

Returns used to be practically guaranteed on anything I purchased.I shopped with confidence. Lately its like they've been taken over. Customer service has actually stooped to telling outright lies. I was accused falsely of returning an empty bottle once they wanted me to prove my innocence. That ended up meaning a loss for me. Recently an agent told me a refund was processed but it never was. I have also gotten used to late deliveries. Its sad to see Amazon go downhill.,US

61d8ade6e1196e51d75d0519,Love/Hate Amazon Relationship,07/01/2022,3,"I have a love/hate relationship with Amazon. I order from them all the time, especially the last few years because it is easier than having to go out and search our local stores for particular items, that often times are not in stock or simply not available where I live. I have also often searched for other online stores to purchase items from but rarely do I find one where I can get free shipping and a lower price. So, though it pains me to do so, if I need to place an order for certain items, I shop on Amazon.That being said, the customer service I personally have received has been pretty awesome, the majority of the time. The key is NOT to buy from a third party seller, as that is a huge headache, in my own experience. Also, you cannot write a review that directly complains about Amazon because they will not ""approve"" it. Which is ridiculous because we all know that Amazon has gone way downhill since the early days.However, that being said, it is possible to get a refund, make a return, and get your money back if you NEVER receive your package. It is a bit of a pain in the a** but it can be done be done. What it takes is patience, persistence, and knowing how to navigate the system. I recently was given a large gift card credit to spend simply because I had such an issue with shipping and it was days past the time my package should have arrived with an item that was an 1/8 of the price of the credit I was given. I used a gift card to purchase it, so I was happy with that.I am the person who manages to get my refunds AND I often get my items for free because I do NOT take NO for an answer. I am polite (for the most part), kind, calm and I do NOT give up. I have experienced many problems with shipping, missing items, items delivered to the wrong apartment, poorly made items, poorly packaged items, products not arriving on time,etc.etc. And each time, customer service has taken care of me. Sometimes it takes more than one phone call and asking for a supervisor, explaining the situation over and over again, but in the end the result is in my favor. I actually fill out the survey the customer service agents email me after the phone call. I am honest and thorough when I fill them out and I praise those exceptional agents who go the extra mile for me, as I appreciate excellent service, as I have been in there shoes in the past.However, if I can find an alternative to shopping at Amazon that also offers free shipping and lower prices, I take it. I would love nothing more than to not have to order another item from them. Obviously, the company treats their employees like crap, the quality of many of their products is merde, they often price gouge, many of their reviews are bogus, the packages are usually not packaged properly or poorly packaged, returns have become a huge pain, many third party sellers rip people off, it can take longer to receive refunds and reviews have to be approved(utter.bullsh**.) Jeff Bezos is making money hand over first, while not paying the amount of taxes or any at all on the billions of dollars he has made and not caring one iota about his employees or his customers. This is what happens when we end up with monopolies and extremely few options available to us. My goal this year is to buy less, continue to search for other online businesses to shop from (especially local ones) and continue to vote, sign petitions and work towards changing the current status quo.",US

615dd554b873f1f75f586b38,Amazon is going DOWN HILL!!,06/10/2021,3,"I have been an Amazon customer for several years now. Since Covid hit I have spent THOUSANDS of dollars with them. Throughout the entire shutdown Amazon NEVER missed a delivery date. In the past several months it has gone SERIOUSLY DOWN HILL!! What is going on?? If you can not deliver an item on time then why do you even put a delivery day on the items? It's ridiculous. I pay for PRIME SERVICE but I am no longer getting it. Sorry, but I don't go for that crap. When I order a product and it specifically gives me a date of arrival BEFORE I ORDER IT!! I consider that a contract! I pay for the service, I pay for the item...but do not receive my order on the promised date. In May of 2021 I had a little incident where some supplies for a customers order got damaged. I immediately ordered what I needed with the ""promise"" of it being delivered the next day. Sometime around 5:00pm (long after it should have already been delivered) I received a text message informing me that it would not be arriving when promised. It was to arrive on May 21st which still would have given me 2 1/2 days to complete my customers order which was to be delivered on the evening of Monday, May 24th.   I did not receive my supplies until the afternoon of May 24th!! Needless to say I could not deliver as promised because Amazon did not deliver as promised. The loss of that order cost me $300.00!! When I called to complain, they had the AUDACITY to offer me a $5.00 credit to my account. ARE YOU KIDDING ME!!?? You cost me $300.00 and you want to compensate that with a $5.00 credit? Talk about a slap in the face. As a matter of fact that was and is THE ONLY time that Amazon had the courtesy of letting me know. Usually they do not even do that much. It's not until I see UPS drive past my house that I realize that something is wrong and then I have to check.They are also starting to get really cheap with their packaging. I have been ordering my makeup from Amazon for quite a while now. It used to come wrapped in bubble wrap in a box. There were no problems. Now they have been sending it in really thin and cheesy mail bags/envelopes and it arrives in pieces. One time they sent 2 glass bottle of foundation, 2 2 compacts of face powder and a tube of mascara all together in a paper shipping bag. Absolutely no padding, bubble wrap or anything!! Well after shipping and UPS throwing it around for a day and a half, I had a real mess on my hands. How much common sense does it actually take for someone to know that 2 glass bottles and some fragile makeup needs to be packed properly with padding and a box?? I see that Amazon sells Waterford Crystal and Austrian crystal wine glasses at $400.00 -$500.00 per half dozen. I can just imagine how they would arrive!!You NEED to get it together Amazon.

UPS refuses to take any fault for packages they lose or deliver to the wrong home, sometimes even in the completely wrong state or town which should be something easy to notice. But apparently as long as they delivered it, it shouldn't matter where and they shouldn't have to refund the product or replace it. It's absolutely disgusting business tactics and their affiliation with UPS Will only ruin their reputation as it continues. I RECOMMEND FINDING A SERVICE NEAR YOU OR ONLY ORDERING FROM CITES THAT USE FEDEX OR REGULAR POSTAL DELIVERY AND NOT UPS.Products 3 stars: pretty wide range of products you'll find anything you need. Its 50 50 on price it'll either cost more than your local store or less so it can be a bargain if used right. ALWAYS READ PRODUCT REVIEWS BEFORE PURCHASE. you'd be surprised what products actually pose the most issues but trust the most recent reviews and make your purchase accordingly. Sometimes the product is good but the means of delivery are awful.Prices 3 stars: all prices are basic standard prices not really any higher ir lower than local prices. You'll save as much as you would using coupons on a store basically. But if you dont like going out because your sick or other reasons, it is very useful to avoid social contact.Customer service 5 stars: these guys are not playing games. If you lose money, theyr losing money to. Take advantage of customer service and be patient!

I was sent an email to say it was rejected. Fair enough. Why it was rejected is not noted so I looked at the guidelines and popped back on to right a review within these guidelines. Not allowed. Barred for writing a review because I really like something? Emailed the address given by Amazon for any questions regarding this. Reply states they cant find the review. Yes that would be correct Amazon- as you rejected it, the review wont be there. I replied and got another email stating I had emailed the wrong place and was given guidelines on how to report dodgy reviews. I have emailed again asking for someone to actually read my first email and let me review the item I purchased.

60ae69e2f9f4870b700f14f3,Mixed bag,26/05/2021,3,"Overall, my experience with Amazon has been a mixed bag. The first two purchases were packaged differently despite practically being the same product, and that is because I bought them from two different sellers. You'd think Amazon would have some consistency and standards even across different sellers, but no. In my case, the biggest complaint here is that the second order was packaged in an inadequate way (it was inside a plastic bag), which created a serious privacy situation I am not going to talk about and which caused me a little bit of embarrassment and fear. Nowadays, it seems like you can inadvertently buy an item from a non-Amazon seller and then end up having such an inconsistent customer service...Amazon should vet sellers more rigorously and enforce some standards. My third order was nothing short of infuriating, it was packaged even worse than my second one, it was a small paperback categorized as a magazine, which meant I could not leave a feedback on how it was handled, something I discovered only when I attempted to do so despite the fact I distinctly remember there being an option to leave an opinion somewhere in the package\receipt itself. And yeah, it was inside a bubble wrap envelope, so it arrived slightly damaged. If only Amazon packaged their products better, I'd seriously consider continuing being a customer, but as of right now, I have to shop from local sellers. Oh, and for God's sake, add the possibility of using PayPal accounts as payment methods, that's also one of the main obstacles.",IT

A couple of items arrived damaged. Thankfully it's just the box not the product itself but it makes you wonder about how they treat your items.

Following day I got a notification to say it would arrive with a couple of additional items i bought as accessories for my main item. The additional items came but not the main one. Message from them saying there was a problem and I was to wait 2 more days and then I could request a refund. Wasn't sure if that meant I wasn't getting it or not, even though it said they would redeliver it 2 days later (3 days after the delivery date I pay a premium for). But why even bring up the option of a refund if you intend to deliver my item? Then at just before 2am, I get a message saying I won't get it at all. And I will get a refund in a couple of days.

5fef4855755dc1032c093ea4,I wish that they would let me choose what packaging material I want to use for my order.,01/01/2021,3,"Amazon.com is a website so huge that its impossible to ignore their impact on society and retail as a whole, they have driven several competitors into bankruptcy including mom and pop stores who cant compete on price, small/medium sized competitors by lowering their prices on products (like baby products) which forces their small/medium sized competitor to lower prices to compete with Amazon and then after they go out of business Amazon will raise their prices when there is no competition around (this has been in news articles). Amazon has also been in the news for things like their poor treatment of fulfillment center employees by timing how many seconds they take to pick an order and pack it, limiting bathroom breaks, and making workers work during Covid-19 even though several of their employees got Covid-19 in their fulfillment centers.So why do you ask do i keep buying from a company like this? for one simple reason, convenience. Amazon has a huge selection of products, they allow for easy and FREE returns within 30 days where other competitors charge restocking fees for returns and make returns at customer expense for shipping costs. Amazon also has a presence in many countries, ive purchased stuff from Amazon Japan, Amazon UK and had the items shipped to the United States very easily.So why did I rate Amazon.com 3/5? well because while they may be very convenient to buy from they also have very poor packaging and dont let customers specify what kind of packaging they want their items shipped in. Amazon has gotten some heat from environmental groups trying to get them to cut down on plastic and cut down on cardboard boxes in the past and we still see petitions online constantly being opened about their packaging. A simple solution would be to let the customer choose what kind of packaging they want their items shipped in during the checkout process and if theres an extra costs associated with more packaging materials then the customer can decide if they want to pay the extra costs or not.I would totally welcome the ability to choose what packaging material Amazon uses for my orders because I would love to be able to order things like art books, movies, collectibles, and video games from Amazon but whenever I try to order any of these items from Amazon they ship the items in a plastic padded envelope 99% of the time or a cardboard box without any packing paper or void fillers and when I finally receive the item it will be all scuffed up or dented during shipping, have a loose disc (movies and video games), or be damaged in some other way so I would have to go through the trouble of returning the item back to Amazon which isnt good for the environment either since it would costs more fuel and packaging material to be sent back to Amazon.The combination of Amazon's business practices, their poor treatment of fulfillment center employees, and their poor quality packaging which prioritizes getting the package to the customer as fast as possible over the condition that the items arrive in at their destination are the reasons why I gave Amazon a 3/5 score.",US

When I purchase products from Amazon, I often choose the product according to the delivery date and that price and delivery date should be honored by Amazon. If there are too many deliveries, hire more drivers. There are lots of people wanting jobs right now. Amazon needs to be a little bit more aware of their “little details”, like the delivery dates.It is now time to purchase items for Christmas. My question is, can I depend on Amazon with delivering the products on time? Or are my gifts going to arrive in 2021.",US

5f95b5e7798e6f04a41d16a7,Why So Many Late Deliveries?? (Long Time Prime Member),25/10/2020,3,"Amazon Prime member for many years.  Getting very disillusioned with Prime delivery/promised delivery dates.Prime promises same day, next day, two day delivery depending upon the product you order.  1) I expect delay of specific or some products due to COVID-19; and, 2) I understand not all products can be delivered in a day.  However, it's now October and I would expect Amazon to have worked-out the majority of promised delivery vs. actual delivery issues, regardless of whether it is an Amazon issue or Prime vendor issue.  Of the orders I have placed over the past 2-3 months, 80%+ have arrived later -- sometimes MUCH later -- than the delivery date stated/selected when I order.In general, it is an inconvenience.  In principle, Amazon is not fulfilling the terms of their PAID Prime Service.  I would much rather order a product and get an HONEST, REALISTIC delivery date than continue to get notifications that the product I've ordered is delayed.In some cases, I would not use Amazon if I knew that my order would not arrive for as much as a week to 10 days after the original delivery date.Prime is a paid Service, with specific consumer promises.  Amazon needs to fulfill these promises or change them.In all fairness, prior to COVID-19 the percentages of late packages was probably reversed (20% late/80% on time).  COVID is a challenge for everyone, and Amazon needs to step up to the plate to adjust their business practices to it.Side note:  First tried to review/leave feedback on the Amazon site but I'm ineligible to review Prime Service there.

I asked him directly; why will you say it on the phone to me and not put it in writing, he said because he isn’t obligated to do that.

And failure in one part of their service will result in bad feedback for Amazon as a whole.So during this sermon (please try to remain awake) I have put down my past experiences with Amazon and it's customer services which to date have been exceptional in resolving my past issues.I think some of the issue’s customers can experience with Amazon occur with the third-party sellers. Amazon overall does a good job of mediating issues with the third-party companies, I myself have had issues in the past with a certain unscrupulous sellers and Amazon after some investigating offered a full refunded.An item that has prime delivery is not necessarily sold by Amazon. Top tip is if you are unsure who a seller is of an item check the right pane and just below the price and the ‘Add to Basket, Buy now, Add to list’ you will see it read Dispatched from and sold by Amazon. If it does not read this it is a third party company.A massive company like Amazon does not need me to put in a good word for it. But myself included it is easier to write a bad review than a good one, as we expect the service to be good from the companies we use and rightly so.So this is me trying to balance the bad reviews I have posted with a semi-constructive review for a company that has rarely let me down, though the couriers on their behalf are another matter (yer I'm talking about you Yodel/Hermes stop putting my mail in the stinky green recycling bin when I have a garden box there right next to it!)Amazon Fan Boy out!!",GB

So therefore I'm eager to write a review. (For the first time in my life). I also wrote one on ConsumerAffairs...Unfortunately I don't have good things to say about Amazon and their attention to customer satisfaction seems below average, despite having so much attention in media about being the best and greatest company in the world. I ordered a spotting scope for my vacation. (NOTE: The item was shipped from and is sold by Amazon.com)I was searching for a certain spotting scope, and I finally found it in stock on Amazon. 14 left. So I order one ASAP. When I receive the package the next week I notice that they sent the wrong item. Well... that's a disappointment, but I would not bash a whole company just because of that. But... Then when trying to order the correct item (only ONE used sample left. fine.. ) I get an error message. I contacted Amazon and they promised me not to worry (like THREE times) and that they would fix it for me. So when they tell me not to worry that many times I trust them about getting this fixed.I get promised:1. They will make sure I will be able to order the correct item even though they seem to almost run out of stock. i.e. I assume they keep one for me. And they would get back to me when they fixed the glitch/error. I would also get 20 USD off.2. They will pick up the wrong item in 2 business day and give me a refund.Sounds great, right? Now I won't go to another company and order the correct item somewhere else, right?Outcome:1. They DON'T get back to me. And when I reach out and ask them if they fixed the glitch so I could order the correct item they told me they could NOT, AND they have run out of stock. ..that's just great.2. Also they STILL have not picked up the package and have yet not refund my purchase.So I contact Amazon again:After getting failed twice in a row and thus ruined my chance of getting hands on this quite rare item, I asked them how they were going to help me. Let me put it this way; they were NOT EVEN WILLING TO CHECK DELIVERY STATUS with the supplier about when they will get the item back in stock. LOL. And for the record, I've been acting very patient the whole time and have had a very decent tone in my writing to them the whole time.A normal, customer satisfaction oriented company would make more effort, but not Amazon. I expected them to provide me with perhaps the correct item that's sold from third party who has it in stock but with a price adjustment compensation (since they sold it for more money) or something similar.And even though one of the agents promised me to give me a price match in case they would change when coming back in stock, the manager I asked to speak to later on told me was misinformation and that they could not even do that.So in conclusion; Amazon failed to deliver correct item and are not willing to make any real effort to make sure I am satisfied as a customer. Hence, I will order the correct item from a competitor and let Amazon pick this wrong item up ASAP.While writing this they still have not picked up the wrong item nor refunded me. Which they initially told me would take two days. It has now been more than a week, and will take more than two weeks in total since I today asked the about this once again and told me 3-5 more business days. That's more than two business days, isn't it? Since the scope is about 1200 USD and since I ordered a new (correct one) from a competitor I will probably have to use my savings/sell shares to afford paying the upcoming amex bill. Just great...",SE

5eea955e7dd75306b8c6bbbd,Shipping is falling short,17/06/2020,3,"Shipping is falling short. It is difficult to find where your stuff is and the ""get it by"" dates are not accurate. They will change the due dates if the item doesn't arrive on time, so that you can't leave genuine feedback about the shipping issues. The tracking information on Amazon is also not matching up to the shipping companies records. I have checked on 3 items and even though Amazon says that the item is out for delivery...the shipping company hasn't received it yet.",US

But they have a big problem with their search app.I searched on 10 foot soaker hose and I pressed the Prime button so I wouldn't see non prime stuff. And I got a list that included regular hoses, a bed for the bedroom and lots of other stuff that had nothing to do with hoses. And there were non-prime items in the list and the same item is listed several times. This is normal now with all my searches. And unless I am very focused, I might buy the wrong item. And then I have to go thru the hassle of returning it.",US
