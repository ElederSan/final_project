data_uncleaned.csv - data contains emojis, special characters, etc. Some models, such as Vader and Textblob are able to recognize symbols, capitales,etc, apparently provide better performance without data preprocessing.
df_premodel.csv - data cleaned but inbalanced, with 46% for positive reviews
data_resampled.csv - data cleaned and balanced via oversampling.
