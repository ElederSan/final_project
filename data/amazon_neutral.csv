65b115680916f543b1a389a3;Bad experience with marketplace seller;45296;2;Unfortunately I had a bad experience which, on the one hand, was the seller's problem, on the other hand I see that Amazon is responsible because, apparently, they let anyone sell on their marketplace. I had an order for a tablet, which not only took almost 3 weeks to arrive, but also came with the wrong specifications. Amazon support said I should resolve it directly with the seller and the seller simply doesn't respond.;US
65afdb177d8134ffaae6549a;I always buy products from Amazon;45292;1;I always buy products from Amazon, BUT if there's a delay they usually don't update the shipping unless the carrier sends a email or txt to update when it's coming. And some of the customer service people are not helpful sometimes are they for real? And also the welfare program, most customers have snap cash ebt, but Amazon accepts food stamps ebt, why can't they accept both? It makes it much harder for customers who only have cash ebt to buy food especially if they have children.;US
65b02d374f07df2dd9dad8b5;No help as usual, this time with the new “One medical”;45314;1;I buy products but getting any help is incredibly cumbersome. I tried reaching out to the new Amazon medical just to ask if they work with the Veteran's Administration. The chat line “ended” the chat before I even got the question out. I tried the chat a dozen times with 0 results. It’s obvious that Amazon doesn’t need our correspondence as we still buy thier products.;US
65b246b77650506acff6d3b2;Touching rock bottom in 2024;45315;1;Amazon used to provide great service until 2023, this year I've noticed a lot of fake reviews. Also I've ordered a product and received something completely different of a lower price. Once I got charge for trainers without receiving a £50 refund. I've given a bad review to the seller and I got the following: We could not post your review because it focuses on one or more of these topics:SellersDeliveryPackagingPricingAvailabilitySo check the reviews very thoroughly when buying on Amazon these days - usually they refer to other products that have nothing to do with what you're buying.I'm sorry as I used to like this service;GB
65b252c6dbd119ab2c125594;Well;45316;4;"Well, y'all lot know what it is. It is the one-stop shop for pretty much everything innit?I am not here to talk about that tho. I am here to talk about the convenience factor that it has created in our lives. It is literally through the roof.I mean, you literally think of someting, ""amazon it"" (I use the term like ""google it"" here) and it can be at your doorstep threshold or in your hand in a matter of days. Selection is massive, options are endless across every sector or industry. Household appliances, consumer electronics, books, clothes, groceries, space crafts and asteroids.. well maybe not that far-fetched, yet.amazon prime's perks are pretty sweet as well, free shipping here, fast shipping there, access to prime video with a large inventory of tv shows, movies and series, prime music included.but the real deal where amazon puts itself forward is the customer service. whenever you have an issue with the product quality, how the seller has treated you, late delivery, or anything of the sorts, they've got your back, bruv.It is all about convenience, variety, reliability and customer satisfaction with these guys. I think they are definitely on the right path and they will be one of the milestone companies that will shape the future for the next generations to come.";DE

Contacted chat, they say they only have an option for Friday, that the date you can select is just an estimate, but when I state I had the option to select a specific day they say oh maybe it will come on Saturday it doesn't show as shipped yet.  Still showing as Friday delivery in my account.  Useless.;GB
65afc6a44a12c8b47d15532a;On black Friday 24 November 2023;45254;1;On black Friday 24 November 2023, I ordered 2x AquaSonic Black Series PRO - Ultra Whitening Toothbrush with UV Disinfectant Base - 4 Modes and Smart Timer - UV Disinfection and Charging Travel Case. 2 months later I still did not receive the date of delivery nor the toothbrushes. I understand the rush after black Friday and before Christmas, but 2 months is outrageous. Even though 2 months have passed I still have no information about when the shipment will be dispatched and when I can expect delivery. I am extremely angry with the lack of communication from Amazon's side, and neglecting of my order. Will initiate all procedures to secure my legally granted consumer rights.;HR

65afa2bd53252a2ca4da1b1f;Amazon CS is lately a complete mess;45314;1;Amazon CS is lately a complete mess. So much so, that I've actually stopped using Amazon. When you have an issue, an agent (on the chat) tells you that they'll take ownership, but it's always a lie. Each and every time you send another email, following-up on the case, you get a template-based answer from a different agent, mostly filled with empty words, and little substance. On several occasions, they've sent me contradicting or incorrect information about delivery dates or deadlines for certain actions. When they give you false information, they don't take any responsibility for it, nor do they ever provide the official complaint form, as they should do as per EU legislation. My time is worth more than the discounts or variety of products they may offer. It's just not worth it.;EE

When I did try calling UPS and said I was calling about a Amazon pick up, they hung up on me 3 times. What is going on with Amazon? Are they on their way  out? It sure does sound like it. Never again Amazon, Ebay, Walmart, Target... Here I come;US
65af491d758e3c43c76a0d14;Amazon Deceptive Discount Policy;45313;1;"Amazon offered what they call a, ""Lightning Discount"", to an item in my cart. The discount was for $81.When I went to check-out, the discount was taken away. I spoke with a supervisor at costumer service, who told me that those discounts last for 15 minutes. To me, that's ridiculous. Especially for a 5 year Prime member, who's spent thousands with Amazon. I learned this after a 2 hour long run-around with customer service. The supervisor refused to re-honor their discount. I'm paying $100 more than Amazon's regular price with one of their competitors. The competitor is honest, and a human being.Amazon's discount policy, in this case, is deceptive. Beware";US
65afcb9ac60b410fed85759b;Don't use Amazon;45313;1;Our package got delivered OK, however the item was damaged (not Amazon's fault) but when I contacted Amazon to arrange a replacement they refused and said they'll accept the item back and refund in 14 days.I understand terms and conditions and have to go along with them if I want to purchase something from Amazon, what I don't understand is how a company trading in our country can still use an Indian call centre with staff that can barely be understood or understand what is getting said to them.Move your call centres that deal with issues from the UK to the UK.Rubbish service, I won't be using Amazon again, I'd rather pay a few pounds more and get a decent service from someone UK based;GB

654d4bac8ba10123d0de12e6;Too Many Weird Companies Selling The Same Thing;45239;3;Lately it seems that your search will reveal many products but are apparently from the same manufacturer. There will be the XYZ company or the Lovemore company or what ever the name is but when you look at each item by different companies they are all the same sales page. Its like there is an uncle who produces the product and six kids and cousins who create a company and sell the products. Sometimes the prices are different or the ship time but its still the same product.Problem is it wastes your shopping time. Also, MANY of these companies have quality issues.Amazon needs to pare down these duplicate search results.;US
65825ee2ebbe291e17a5d640;Overall good site but just be careful;45231;3;Overall good site. Delivers when they say. The only issue I have is my card was replaced while in a trial of prime that was 1.99. When I went to update it, they didn't even let me finish my week of prime (I was only 3 days in) and they charged me 14.99 right away. So I paid 16.99 for a month in reality and customer service said because I used it. (Um like people do with a PAID trial) I was just basically out of that money. So I'll order again but never will I ever use prime again.;US

Not once. Do not fall for it. And it appears some of their drivers are either illiterate or just lazy or both. I order all the time from Amazon because it is convenient but Temu offers much better deals and even though the shipping takes longer, they don't lie about that and you get a credit if it's late.";US

However, the 2-day shipping that used to be reliable is no longer reliable.  I would prefer they lower the cost of Prime and just NOT PROMISE 2-day delivery any longer. I understand we are in difficult economic times but if a company can no longer deliver what it promises, then perhaps it should just drop the service altogether.  In the past, I have paid yearly in advance for Prime (since it was $99/year), but have now switched to monthly Prime subscription because I want to be able to easily bail out if the service gets any worse.

Previously, it was like everything I purchased was coming late. Today, I get a message that my package will be late. Please, let's not start this cycle again. I'm leaving a review based on the company itself. I would like to make a suggestion. When, a Primes member orders items within a certain time frame to have them delivered by a certain day, that's what we expect. Some of us are business owners, work from home, and have projects to complete. Paying for a service just to receive items late is a mute point. Here's my suggestion. For every order a prime member does not receive by the correct time frame indicated, you refund half the purchase price or give a $15 Amazon credit automatically. This means prime members should not have to call in and request this credit. You should have a designated team who keeps track of shipping to ensure orders will be delivered on time and when they are not, you credit the prime membes' account and send the notification of received our items late. How does that sound. Because $5 isn't enough. Truth be told $15 isn't either. However, it's more that $5.;US

This is somewhat suspect because there is no reception area or anywhere safe to leave it, except with a neighbour. It wasn’t left with one of them.I enquired about this on Amazon chat. To be told the delivery status was updated too early. Strange… Apologies were given and the new delivery date was 8th of June 2023.Surprise, surprise…the parcel still didn’t arrive on 8th June.I called Amazon customer service and informed them about this. The customer advisor stated they need to speak to their manager. I explained they are in breach of contract the goods never arrived and funds have been taken. I asked for a full refund.To be fair, after the advisor had spoke to their boss. They stated I would have a refund in up to 5 working days. They also told me I could keep the items if they arrived. Of course, the items never arrived.I received a confirmation email of my refund being processed. Thankfully, I received a full refund including the postage and packaging I paid for too.Despite the initial frustration to start with, I’m happy I got a hassle free refund experience. Although, I am somewhat reluctant to order from Amazon incase a parcel doesn’t arrive again.;GB

637d0cbcb84cc27618f3b663;Advantages outweigh the disadvantages;44887;3;For me the advantages favour me to shop here but the place is far from perfect. The customer service, when an issue arises is low rate. You will be speaking to staff from India and they have know idea how to address a normal conversation which makes the entire experience an absolute waste of time. Away from that most of it is beneficial. Being in the City Centre Amazon performs well. Although the live tracking sucks. In 2022 you know customer service is almost non existence and everything is heading in a way to become less interactive with humans. But it’s probably the better service compared to the rest that’s out there. It’s classic consumerism consuming us. Spend with care, it will always get worst not better.;GB

I enquired as to why a replacement wasn't sent as it is still available to purchase on their website, but was not 'that was not possible' they informed me I could reorder the item, but at the new higher price (150 pounds more than it was on sale) it feels as if they simply didn't wish to honour the sale price which I feel they should have done.;GB

63af46d74d0773066a29ba32;Good service, poor communication;44925;3;On the whole Amazon provide a very good service, but their Achillies heel is a lack of effective communication when things go wrong.A classic example is that it is impossible to get an answer to the following question: Why is it that when logging in from a different device, you are sent an email asking for confirmation it is you and quoting a geographical location than can be as much 150 miles away from where you logged in. This has always been an issue and has nothing to do with fraud.There is also a new issue with returns: once an item has been returned and it has arrived at the warehouse you would previously receive an automatic email confirming receipt and that the refund process has been started and the funds will be in your account within a specific time frame. This is not happening now so you have no idea if it has even arrived let alone when your refund will arrive.The underlying issue is that Amazon have no procedure for lodging a complaint in writing.;GB
6507cb31e315f28adfd61b6e;I purchased a dive watch from Amazon on…;45184;3;I purchased a dive watch from Amazon on 8/29/23. The item came on time. However, it was defective. So, rather than get a refund, I ordered a replacement on 9/2/23. The package was supposed to arrive in two to three days. I am still waiting for the item. It is now almost 9/18. I am a Prime customer, and have spent quite a lot of money with them over the years. I've called their customer service numerous times. I keep getting the same scripted answers. Sounds like a run-around to me. The item is in transit, they keep repeating. When I checked the USPS tracking history, the last date is 14 days ago, on 9/4/23, stating awaiting receipt of item. In other words, the Post Office hasn't even received the package. Even Amazon's own website says the package may be lost, and to request a refund or replacement. I was told to call back on 9/20 for them to investigate further. That's 18 days since I ordered the item. What a joke. I barely can understand these reps over the phone. Sound familiar? This is the last time I will ever order a big-ticket item from them. Before, Amazon promptly refunded me or sent out a replacement right away. This is how you lose loyal customers!Post Script (9/26/23): I was finally issued a refund,18 days after I purchased the watch. The item never arrived, nor did the USPS ever receive my package. I got an email from their customer service saying that the package was deemed 'not deliverable' and sent back to an Amazon facility. Just what I was telling them all along. As a Prime customer, I should not have to wait nearly three weeks. Amazon could have sent me a replacement. Again, this is not a good way to treat their loyal customers.;US
640e41abd35c1066e9077e0b;I've been a monthly customer of Amazon…;44991;3;I've been a monthly customer of Amazon for years and have 2 primary complaints about the online shopping service. 1)I gave fare/honest reviews of merch I purchased - mostly an adequate rating, a few bad and a few excellent reviews - but Amazon removed my ability to review for a couple years now without adequate explanation. I feel duty bound to warn other customers about items I've purchased that are advertized fraudulently or defective, which Amazon does not allow me to do. I expect Amazon as a middleman service suffers from conflict of interest when it comes to the various companies for which they brokers, so it censors reviews for the businesses it's too close to, in order to protect its sells. This is siding with these companies that sell substandard merchandise against Amazon members, and should immediately stop. Ever paying Amazon shopper should have an unhindered right to review the items they paid for.2) Amazon listings needs to clarify differences in sizing scale when merch is manufactured in different countries, which it most often fails to do. For example, I cannot tell you number of times I purchased items manufactured in China, according to Chinese sizing scale - which is about 2-sizes smaller than US sizing - without being warned by Amazon. The result being, merchandise That doesn't fit - clothes, backpack, laptop case - I either haveto go through headache of returning, just givaway, or trash.;US

645bc803d9bdf3cf3330c479;Decent Quality, but Watch Out for Extra Costs;45047;3;As a longtime customer of Amazon.com, I have mixed feelings about my recent experiences with the company. While I can't deny the consistently good quality of their products and services, I can't overlook the growing trend of additional charges for certain features. It has left me feeling moderately satisfied with my overall experience.One aspect that has always stood out for me is the impressive range of products available on Amazon. Whether I'm looking for electronics, home goods, or even niche items, I can usually find what I need. The quality of the products I've purchased has generally been reliable, and I appreciate the convenience of having everything delivered right to my doorstep.However, my contentment has been somewhat dampened by the increasing number of features that come at an extra cost. Previously, I enjoyed the simplicity of a Prime membership, which included fast shipping and access to a decent selection of movies, TV shows, and books. Unfortunately, it seems like more and more perks are being pulled behind additional paywalls, which can be frustrating.For instance, the introduction of Amazon Prime Video Channels, which require separate subscriptions for certain content providers, has made the streaming experience less appealing. It feels like I'm being nickel-and-dimed for every additional service, making it harder to justify the extra expenses.;DE

I ordered 2 mascaras recently and it was suppose to come Thursday and suddenly I get a notification it's delivered today and left in the letterbox when it was not there at all, so disappointed, I'm never going to order to my apartament as my parcels are always never delivered, only if they're large parcels then they arrive as I'm shown tracking, and it arrives to me as I wait downstairs, also depends who delivers it, but when it comes to small packages it's always a problem, I'm awaiting a refund and re delivered same item to new address. Plus I didn't get a tracking map this time for this one  the delivery just flew out of nowhere, it kept saying delivering tomorrow then today and just switching up.;GB

645a5f24c42bfa7c3a993e43;What ever happened to 2-day shipping…;45055;3;"What ever happened to 2-day shipping for Amazon Prime membership?And why isn't there a link somewhere about the Amazon website to contact customer service?  Why does it take about 5 minutes (not exaggerating) to drill down, answer questions, meet criteria and generally jump through hoops in order to get to the point where you can ask a question of a customer service rep?I get that its HUGE but does that exonerate them from basic business practices and being available to their customers?  Is it impossible to imagine that there are some questions that can't be answered by the options they offer up in a list?The COVID pandemic wreaked havoc upon society worldwide and created new standards and expectations for and about work, workers, customers, customer services, etc. and during that time it was impossible to fulfill Prime membership benefits like 2-day shipping, but it's long since and they've not yet reinstated the 2-day shipping policy.Go to amazon and look up prime membership benefits and the list includes video and kindle and music benefits but, all of those come with a monthly subscription fee separate from the $139 annual fee for Prime membership.The shipping benefits listed for Prime Membership reflect two-day shipping on ""select"" items, so perhaps just the ""select"" item list got pared back during COVID and has never been 're-augmented'?Whatever the answer, I'm not sure Amazon prime membership is worth it anymore - certainly not if you're paying for it monthly; but perhaps even the annual membership doesn't make sense?It's rare that I need anything the next day or even two-days later and I'll frequently select delivery on my amazon delivery day, but when I do need something within' two-days, I'm finding Walmart to be more receptive to those needs (and they often deliver the next day AND on Sundays).Me thinks Amazon has gotten too big for it's britches and forgets the trail-blazing they once did only to foist buggy service upon us now.And don't get me started on dropping Amazon returns at a Whole Foods, especially one in NYC  The Upper East Side Whole Foods at 87th & 3rd has a huge Amazon Returns sign with that big smiley swoosh beneath it, so you know you're in the right place, but there's no additional signage to tell you to go to the Mezzanine which is accessible only by elevator (don't take the escalator bc it bypasses the Mezz altogether).";US

The first was I was randomly not allowed to do so. The second was that a review had been taken down with no more than a vague explanation, and a link to all their rules, which isn't helpful for letting me alter my review to follow reviewer standards. This also makes me concerned of the validity of customer reviews and how they're filtered though.I also spent a while seeing if I could reach customer support without either calling, or being in active conversation with them and no luck. Can't stand companies that intentionally make it difficult to contact them.;CA
635d0f36252cba2c02c9593f;Amazon books orders;44854;3;Amazon books orders. Mostly acceptable service from Amazon. However, oftentimes you get slightly dog eared edges to your ordered new book corners. This seems to be quite common showing lack of care in their handling of the books prior to or during picking or packing out of the order. This is slightly annoying. Overall delivery is good. Selection of US published book titles very good. Better probably than Waterstones or Book Depository too. Ordered were Krav Maga manuals titles and instructional all region DVD.

Then day after day I annoyed the hell out of them. I wrote them multiple times a day while complaining. I contacted the delivery company which is in my eyes partly responsible. They ignored me for whole 7 days. I also did contact the manufacturer but Amazon still didn't really feel the pressure. So I decided to annoy again and again and again and again until I had another idea. Let's just directly mail Andy Jassy the ceo of Amazon which I did next. I did mention that in the customer support chat and 10 seconds later I got reconnected to someone from problem prevention or something like that and then I explained to them everything again and then 15 min later I'm not even joking they organized a replacement order just like that. Finally!!!!!? But I have really mixed feelings about all the hassle you have to go through first until you mention Andy Jassy and suddenly everything goes really fast. Don't know how to feel about that hence the 3 stars. You should be like that without that I feel I have to pressure Amazon in such a way and annoy them until something is happening. Being relentless paid off but shouldn't be necessary to be honest;DE

Recently, I cancelled an expensive lighting fixture order, but the company sent it (after Amazon sent me a message saying the order was cancelled). I have been trying for almost two months to get a return label for a $500 item. Additionally, today, I received a NextBase 422GW car dash cam instead of a 622GW from a third party seller. This was a birthday gift for 9/22. My son helped me drive his birthday gift to an Amazon locker for return. The seller sent an old version at the new version price. And, last week, Amazon Warehouse delivered a microwave upside down with broken foam that was hugely dented inside and out for a small markdown. It looks like trash and cost $300 with tax. Now, I have to repackage this heavy item and bring it to UPS and go without a microwave, or reorder through Amazon (rewarding incompetence).

61d8ade6e1196e51d75d0519;Love/Hate Amazon Relationship;44568;3;"I have a love/hate relationship with Amazon. I order from them all the time, especially the last few years because it is easier than having to go out and search our local stores for particular items, that often times are not in stock or simply not available where I live. I have also often searched for other online stores to purchase items from but rarely do I find one where I can get free shipping and a lower price. So, though it pains me to do so, if I need to place an order for certain items, I shop on Amazon.That being said, the customer service I personally have received has been pretty awesome, the majority of the time. The key is NOT to buy from a third party seller, as that is a huge headache, in my own experience. Also, you cannot write a review that directly complains about Amazon because they will not ""approve"" it. Which is ridiculous because we all know that Amazon has gone way downhill since the early days.However, that being said, it is possible to get a refund, make a return, and get your money back if you NEVER receive your package. It is a bit of a pain in the a** but it can be done be done. What it takes is patience, persistence, and knowing how to navigate the system. I recently was given a large gift card credit to spend simply because I had such an issue with shipping and it was days past the time my package should have arrived with an item that was an 1/8 of the price of the credit I was given. I used a gift card to purchase it, so I was happy with that.I am the person who manages to get my refunds AND I often get my items for free because I do NOT take NO for an answer. I am polite (for the most part), kind, calm and I do NOT give up. I have experienced many problems with shipping, missing items, items delivered to the wrong apartment, poorly made items, poorly packaged items, products not arriving on time,etc.etc. And each time, customer service has taken care of me. Sometimes it takes more than one phone call and asking for a supervisor, explaining the situation over and over again, but in the end the result is in my favor. I actually fill out the survey the customer service agents email me after the phone call. I am honest and thorough when I fill them out and I praise those exceptional agents who go the extra mile for me, as I appreciate excellent service, as I have been in there shoes in the past.However, if I can find an alternative to shopping at Amazon that also offers free shipping and lower prices, I take it. I would love nothing more than to not have to order another item from them. Obviously, the company treats their employees like crap, the quality of many of their products is merde, they often price gouge, many of their reviews are bogus, the packages are usually not packaged properly or poorly packaged, returns have become a huge pain, many third party sellers rip people off, it can take longer to receive refunds and reviews have to be approved(utter.bullsh**.) Jeff Bezos is making money hand over first, while not paying the amount of taxes or any at all on the billions of dollars he has made and not caring one iota about his employees or his customers. This is what happens when we end up with monopolies and extremely few options available to us. My goal this year is to buy less, continue to search for other online businesses to shop from (especially local ones) and continue to vote, sign petitions and work towards changing the current status quo.";US

When it wasn't delivered, I aain contacted customer service to be told it would not be delivered until 4 days after Christmas.  I requested a refund at this time and was offered a promotional credit for the inconvenience.  I then contacted customer service because the promotional credit was not showing on the account only to find out the credit is only usable if I find and purchase a product sold by Amazon specifically (not a vendor of Amazon). So purchase something I may not want just to use a ""credit"" applied? In other words, give Amazon my money. Getting pretty tired of the bad business with Amazon.";US

615dd554b873f1f75f586b38;Amazon is going DOWN HILL!!;44475;3;"I have been an Amazon customer for several years now. Since Covid hit I have spent THOUSANDS of dollars with them. Throughout the entire shutdown Amazon NEVER missed a delivery date. In the past several months it has gone SERIOUSLY DOWN HILL!! What is going on?? If you can not deliver an item on time then why do you even put a delivery day on the items? It's ridiculous. I pay for PRIME SERVICE but I am no longer getting it. Sorry, but I don't go for that crap. When I order a product and it specifically gives me a date of arrival BEFORE I ORDER IT!! I consider that a contract! I pay for the service, I pay for the item...but do not receive my order on the promised date. In May of 2021 I had a little incident where some supplies for a customers order got damaged. I immediately ordered what I needed with the ""promise"" of it being delivered the next day. Sometime around 5:00pm (long after it should have already been delivered) I received a text message informing me that it would not be arriving when promised. It was to arrive on May 21st which still would have given me 2 1/2 days to complete my customers order which was to be delivered on the evening of Monday, May 24th.   I did not receive my supplies until the afternoon of May 24th!! Needless to say I could not deliver as promised because Amazon did not deliver as promised. The loss of that order cost me $300.00!! When I called to complain, they had the AUDACITY to offer me a $5.00 credit to my account. ARE YOU KIDDING ME!!?? You cost me $300.00 and you want to compensate that with a $5.00 credit? Talk about a slap in the face. As a matter of fact that was and is THE ONLY time that Amazon had the courtesy of letting me know. Usually they do not even do that much. It's not until I see UPS drive past my house that I realize that something is wrong and then I have to check.They are also starting to get really cheap with their packaging. I have been ordering my makeup from Amazon for quite a while now. It used to come wrapped in bubble wrap in a box. There were no problems. Now they have been sending it in really thin and cheesy mail bags/envelopes and it arrives in pieces. One time they sent 2 glass bottle of foundation, 2 2 compacts of face powder and a tube of mascara all together in a paper shipping bag. Absolutely no padding, bubble wrap or anything!! Well after shipping and UPS throwing it around for a day and a half, I had a real mess on my hands. How much common sense does it actually take for someone to know that 2 glass bottles and some fragile makeup needs to be packed properly with padding and a box?? I see that Amazon sells Waterford Crystal and Austrian crystal wine glasses at $400.00 -$500.00 per half dozen. I can just imagine how they would arrive!!You NEED to get it together Amazon.

612016d5150e959f0f1cf6cd;Delivery services are sadly mainly UPS;44428;3;Delivery NO STARS: They mainly use UPS which has consistently lost or wrong address delivered packages. UPS refuses to take any fault for packages they lose or deliver to the wrong home, sometimes even in the completely wrong state or town which should be something easy to notice. But apparently as long as they delivered it, it shouldn't matter where and they shouldn't have to refund the product or replace it. It's absolutely disgusting business tactics and their affiliation with UPS Will only ruin their reputation as it continues. I RECOMMEND FINDING A SERVICE NEAR YOU OR ONLY ORDERING FROM CITES THAT USE FEDEX OR REGULAR POSTAL DELIVERY AND NOT UPS.Products 3 stars: pretty wide range of products you'll find anything you need. Its 50 50 on price it'll either cost more than your local store or less so it can be a bargain if used right. ALWAYS READ PRODUCT REVIEWS BEFORE PURCHASE. you'd be surprised what products actually pose the most issues but trust the most recent reviews and make your purchase accordingly. Sometimes the product is good but the means of delivery are awful.Prices 3 stars: all prices are basic standard prices not really any higher ir lower than local prices. You'll save as much as you would using coupons on a store basically. But if you dont like going out because your sick or other reasons, it is very useful to avoid social contact.Customer service 5 stars: these guys are not playing games. If you lose money, theyr losing money to. Take advantage of customer service and be patient! I have had wonderful results and always ended up getting a refund or a return with their help, all be it sometimes it's a long process so again, patience is key.

60aef358f9f4870a94ae3805;Prime;44343;3;Overall, I do enjoy Amazon. I'm not much of a fan of their Prime Membership, simply because everything I would buy never does fall under their Membership. So it's always an added and unnecessary expense.When that happens you still pay for for the shipping, and then wait for the item to arrive, whenever it gets there, rather than enjoying the 2 day, free shipping that you're paying for with prime. It just seems more like a waste of money to me.But I've never had an issue with Amazon itself.;US
60ae69e2f9f4870b700f14f3;Mixed bag;44342;3;Overall, my experience with Amazon has been a mixed bag. The first two purchases were packaged differently despite practically being the same product, and that is because I bought them from two different sellers. You'd think Amazon would have some consistency and standards even across different sellers, but no. In my case, the biggest complaint here is that the second order was packaged in an inadequate way (it was inside a plastic bag), which created a serious privacy situation I am not going to talk about and which caused me a little bit of embarrassment and fear. Nowadays, it seems like you can inadvertently buy an item from a non-Amazon seller and then end up having such an inconsistent customer service...Amazon should vet sellers more rigorously and enforce some standards. My third order was nothing short of infuriating, it was packaged even worse than my second one, it was a small paperback categorized as a magazine, which meant I could not leave a feedback on how it was handled, something I discovered only when I attempted to do so despite the fact I distinctly remember there being an option to leave an opinion somewhere in the package\receipt itself. And yeah, it was inside a bubble wrap envelope, so it arrived slightly damaged. If only Amazon packaged their products better, I'd seriously consider continuing being a customer, but as of right now, I have to shop from local sellers. Oh, and for God's sake, add the possibility of using PayPal accounts as payment methods, that's also one of the main obstacles.;IT

601f4964679d970358faa3f4;2 damaged items and an unexplained cancellation;44234;3;I use Amazon a lot. And for the most part it's fine. However just recently it's been a bit of a joke. A couple of items arrived damaged. Thankfully it's just the box not the product itself but it makes you wonder about how they treat your items. Then I also pay for Amazon Prime, the idea being next day delivery. Ordered an item and didn't receive it next day. Following day I got a notification to say it would arrive with a couple of additional items i bought as accessories for my main item. The additional items came but not the main one. Message from them saying there was a problem and I was to wait 2 more days and then I could request a refund. Wasn't sure if that meant I wasn't getting it or not, even though it said they would redeliver it 2 days later (3 days after the delivery date I pay a premium for). But why even bring up the option of a refund if you intend to deliver my item? Then at just before 2am, I get a message saying I won't get it at all. And I will get a refund in a couple of days. So I pay a premium for you to make me wait longer than expected and then not send the item and make me wait for a refund. No explanation either. It's really annoying. Makes me think twice about using them again and makes me wonder about Prime membership.;GB

5fef4855755dc1032c093ea4;I wish that they would let me choose what packaging material I want to use for my order.;44197;3;Amazon.com is a website so huge that its impossible to ignore their impact on society and retail as a whole, they have driven several competitors into bankruptcy including mom and pop stores who cant compete on price, small/medium sized competitors by lowering their prices on products (like baby products) which forces their small/medium sized competitor to lower prices to compete with Amazon and then after they go out of business Amazon will raise their prices when there is no competition around (this has been in news articles). Amazon has also been in the news for things like their poor treatment of fulfillment center employees by timing how many seconds they take to pick an order and pack it, limiting bathroom breaks, and making workers work during Covid-19 even though several of their employees got Covid-19 in their fulfillment centers.So why do you ask do i keep buying from a company like this? for one simple reason, convenience. Amazon has a huge selection of products, they allow for easy and FREE returns within 30 days where other competitors charge restocking fees for returns and make returns at customer expense for shipping costs. Amazon also has a presence in many countries, ive purchased stuff from Amazon Japan, Amazon UK and had the items shipped to the United States very easily.So why did I rate Amazon.com 3/5? well because while they may be very convenient to buy from they also have very poor packaging and dont let customers specify what kind of packaging they want their items shipped in. Amazon has gotten some heat from environmental groups trying to get them to cut down on plastic and cut down on cardboard boxes in the past and we still see petitions online constantly being opened about their packaging. A simple solution would be to let the customer choose what kind of packaging they want their items shipped in during the checkout process and if theres an extra costs associated with more packaging materials then the customer can decide if they want to pay the extra costs or not.I would totally welcome the ability to choose what packaging material Amazon uses for my orders because I would love to be able to order things like art books, movies, collectibles, and video games from Amazon but whenever I try to order any of these items from Amazon they ship the items in a plastic padded envelope 99% of the time or a cardboard box without any packing paper or void fillers and when I finally receive the item it will be all scuffed up or dented during shipping, have a loose disc (movies and video games), or be damaged in some other way so I would have to go through the trouble of returning the item back to Amazon which isnt good for the environment either since it would costs more fuel and packaging material to be sent back to Amazon.The combination of Amazon's business practices, their poor treatment of fulfillment center employees, and their poor quality packaging which prioritizes getting the package to the customer as fast as possible over the condition that the items arrive in at their destination are the reasons why I gave Amazon a 3/5 score.;US

For Example Prime member's, delivery is stated two days, sometimes three days. these delivery dates are always stated right on that page. But  following my last purchase, I received a notice that the product delivery date had been extended by two or three days. (So I canceled the purchase).And now I find that Prime Video has commercials... COMMERCIALS. Folks, I do not pay a monthly fee for commercials. I get enough of that with Directv. This was one reason I chose a prime membership. I do not pay a monthly fee to have my delivery date made LATE  by two or three days. The date on the product details page. (And I always take a screenshot of the page at the time of the purchase) should be the same price and date that the product is actually delivered. When I purchase products from Amazon, I often choose the product according to the delivery date and that price and delivery date should be honored by Amazon. If there are too many deliveries, hire more drivers. There are lots of people wanting jobs right now.

Getting very disillusioned with Prime delivery/promised delivery dates.Prime promises same day, next day, two day delivery depending upon the product you order.  1) I expect delay of specific or some products due to COVID-19; and, 2) I understand not all products can be delivered in a day.  However, it's now October and I would expect Amazon to have worked-out the majority of promised delivery vs. actual delivery issues, regardless of whether it is an Amazon issue or Prime vendor issue.  Of the orders I have placed over the past 2-3 months, 80%+ have arrived later -- sometimes MUCH later -- than the delivery date stated/selected when I order.In general, it is an inconvenience.  In principle, Amazon is not fulfilling the terms of their PAID Prime Service.  I would much rather order a product and get an HONEST, REALISTIC delivery date than continue to get notifications that the product I've ordered is delayed.In some cases, I would not use Amazon if I knew that my order would not arrive for as much as a week to 10 days after the original delivery date.Prime is a paid Service, with specific consumer promises.  Amazon needs to fulfill these promises or change them.In all fairness, prior to COVID-19 the percentages of late packages was probably reversed (20% late/80% on time).  COVID is a challenge for everyone, and Amazon needs to step up to the plate to adjust their business practices to it.Side note:  First tried to review/leave feedback on the Amazon site but I'm ineligible to review Prime Service there.

5f863a6a798e6f0bcc449473;Good pricing, bad screw ups.;44117;3;"Good pricing, good products, but when they mess up, they mess up bad with little to no compensation.I’ve bought from Amazon many times.  When their customer service agents say someone will get back to you, know that they will never get back to you.  Have heard that at least a dozen separate times and never once has anyone got back to me.They can usually correct things pretty quick, but the problems thst get them there are usually pretty bad and they do nothing or very little to mitigate the issue.Overall I still buy from them because of the pricing but I am starting to slow down on purchases because their poor resolution on multiple problems has had me spend way too much time on the phone with them correcting their mistakes while I am actually paying to correct them for them, by being a customer.I have also caught them in their own policy lies and have it recorded where the agent refuses to put in writing what he says on the phone, even though he will put other things in writing.  I asked him directly; why will you say it on the phone to me and not put it in writing, he said because he isn’t obligated to do that.  Unbelievable.I think this company is dealing with the massive influx of sales during the pandemic and though I have little sympathy for the trillions in profit... overall they do pretty good job... when they mess up it can be pretty bad... but usually they don’t mess up and usually things will sort out.  I wish I could more easily support Canadian retailers though.";CA

When they are bad, they will charge your debit card twice just to see if you have money in your card....yes that's the reason they gave when I asked why. (rolled eyes)I will always cancel order when they try to charge my debit card a second time. They can very well take the money that was previously put on hold but nope, they want to charge again! So I will always cancel and bring my business elsewhere even if it costs a little more.My recent order was with the same debit card and they did not charge twice. Just once, take the money and delivered the goods. Now why can't they just do that all the time??Charging twice is off putting and defo made me shop elsewhere every time they try sh_t like that with my debit card.

5f2bf6ff1a5a6907a47c1610;The Ocassional Roulette of Support;44049;3;****Latest entry*****So as my previous review went I have been happily shopping with Amazon since 2005 and the customer support has been exemplary.So what the hell happened, back to back to back issues, generic responses, can only us their crap chat or 'call you' which never calls me!Shambolic, gradually weaning myself off Amazon and shopping elsewhere.What went wrong!?!*****Original post*****It is quite hard to review a certain aspect of Amazon as they provide so many services, of which I subscribe to being a Prime customer, premium Amazon music and own numerous echo and fire devices. And failure in one part of their service will result in bad feedback for Amazon as a whole.So during this sermon (please try to remain awake) I have put down my past experiences with Amazon and it's customer services which to date have been exceptional in resolving my past issues.I think some of the issue’s customers can experience with Amazon occur with the third-party sellers. Amazon overall does a good job of mediating issues with the third-party companies, I myself have had issues in the past with a certain unscrupulous sellers and Amazon after some investigating offered a full refunded.An item that has prime delivery is not necessarily sold by Amazon. Top tip is if you are unsure who a seller is of an item check the right pane and just below the price and the ‘Add to Basket, Buy now, Add to list’ you will see it read Dispatched from and sold by Amazon. If it does not read this it is a third party company.A massive company like Amazon does not need me to put in a good word for it. But myself included it is easier to write a bad review than a good one, as we expect the service to be good from the companies we use and rightly so.So this is me trying to balance the bad reviews I have posted with a semi-constructive review for a company that has rarely let me down, though the couriers on their behalf are another matter (yer I'm talking about you Yodel/Hermes stop putting my mail in the stinky green recycling bin when I have a garden box there right next to it!)Amazon Fan Boy out!!;GB

Amazon leaves it up to the customer to research their sellers to find out if they are legitimate and follow good business practices. They also do a terrible job with packaging their orders. I received an order of 3 reams of copy paper that was put in this giant box that would be suited for a huge picture frame. The reams of paper slid all around inside and the product packing was all tore up. The paper was a mess! Amazon packaging is also very wasteful. I once received 3 little packs of Name badge stickers in a box a little bigger than a shoebox!

I recently purchased tires from Amazon and the system told me they had been delivered to the installer.  When I contacted the installer, they inform me they have not been recvd.  This initiated hours of time spent trying to contact someone to find out what happened.  They claimed they fixed and set a new date and then promptly missed it.  In total, from order to installation was three weeks.  Completely unacceptable.  Also, I have never had a review published on Amazon.  They filter each review and if there is any negative comment about Amazon, the review is denied.;US
5f030b5c3f06f20a94d9c81a;First I get the wrong item....;44018;3;"I feel obliged to EDIT this review given latest update in this matter: I have increased the rating to three stars (previously 1 star) since I finally got assistance from another manager who acknowledged the mishandling of my case and compensated me for the mistakes. *Anything below this text is untouched*It bothers me when such a powerful and successful business continue to grow while they are actually not living up to their own greatness... So therefore I'm eager to write a review. (For the first time in my life). I also wrote one on ConsumerAffairs...Unfortunately I don't have good things to say about Amazon and their attention to customer satisfaction seems below average, despite having so much attention in media about being the best and greatest company in the world. I ordered a spotting scope for my vacation. (NOTE: The item was shipped from and is sold by Amazon.com)I was searching for a certain spotting scope, and I finally found it in stock on Amazon. 14 left. So I order one ASAP. When I receive the package the next week I notice that they sent the wrong item. Well... that's a disappointment, but I would not bash a whole company just because of that. But... Then when trying to order the correct item (only ONE used sample left. fine.. ) I get an error message. I contacted Amazon and they promised me not to worry (like THREE times) and that they would fix it for me. So when they tell me not to worry that many times I trust them about getting this fixed.I get promised:1. They will make sure I will be able to order the correct item even though they seem to almost run out of stock. i.e. I assume they keep one for me. And they would get back to me when they fixed the glitch/error. I would also get 20 USD off.2. They will pick up the wrong item in 2 business day and give me a refund.Sounds great, right? Now I won't go to another company and order the correct item somewhere else, right?Outcome:1. They DON'T get back to me. And when I reach out and ask them if they fixed the glitch so I could order the correct item they told me they could NOT, AND they have run out of stock. ..that's just great.2. Also they STILL have not picked up the package and have yet not refund my purchase.So I contact Amazon again:After getting failed twice in a row and thus ruined my chance of getting hands on this quite rare item, I asked them how they were going to help me. Let me put it this way; they were NOT EVEN WILLING TO CHECK DELIVERY STATUS with the supplier about when they will get the item back in stock. LOL. And for the record, I've been acting very patient the whole time and have had a very decent tone in my writing to them the whole time.A normal, customer satisfaction oriented company would make more effort, but not Amazon. I expected them to provide me with perhaps the correct item that's sold from third party who has it in stock but with a price adjustment compensation (since they sold it for more money) or something similar.And even though one of the agents promised me to give me a price match in case they would change when coming back in stock, the manager I asked to speak to later on told me was misinformation and that they could not even do that.So in conclusion; Amazon failed to deliver correct item and are not willing to make any real effort to make sure I am satisfied as a customer. Hence, I will order the correct item from a competitor and let Amazon pick this wrong item up ASAP.While writing this they still have not picked up the wrong item nor refunded me. Which they initially told me would take two days. It has now been more than a week, and will take more than two weeks in total since I today asked the about this once again and told me 3-5 more business days. That's more than two business days, isn't it? Since the scope is about 1200 USD and since I ordered a new (correct one) from a competitor I will probably have to use my savings/sell shares to afford paying the upcoming amex bill. Just great...";SE

5ec1910b25e5d209b8ed82ed;Think twice before ordering from - Do a quick search, bet you will get better, personal service;43968;3;"Think twice before ordering from Amazon.  Amazon has been a very decent outlet to purchase items.  Recently, I've learned to take a look at items sold locally in the US.  I ordered a pair of professional nail clippers.  Not realizing it, I ordered them from overseas and learned that it would take over a month to get the order.  I looked around and found a cheaper pair in Florida and and had them within 5 days over a weekend, regular mail.  The worst is I ordered a card table.  Easy right.  It would take another month to get it, which was good timing for me.  It was shipped by UPS, Amazon put a hold on it and directed UPS to stop shipment.  When I called UPS, they said I had to contact Amazon at the their website address.  There was nothing else that I could do.  Went to contact Amazon and it was a BOT-computerized; no customer service, no help site.  I re-ordered the card table from Amazon because now I needed it and couldn't wait any longer.  After several days passed, my 2nd order for the card table was not even processed.  I decided to look around and found the exact table at Bed Bath and Beyond.  I ordered it online for the same price with a coupon and it was at my door in less than a week.  I cancelled my order at Amazon.  My business will decrease significantly at Amazon.  I don't like how you treat your employees and your service is no longer acceptable.";US

5ebd6d3425e5d20a8895af6d;Amazon, wake up... you have the virus!;43965;3;Two months ago I would have given them 5 stars. I have been an Amazon Prime member for a couple of years now. I have always loved this company and web site.., and then came covid-19!!! I am not complaining about the slower (much slower) shipping... we all have to adjust to aid each other. What I am talking about is their product line & what they have aided Chinese companies in doing. For instance: I wanted to find “hand sanitizer.”  If you go to the other well-known ‘brick and mortar’ sites you will find it marked, “Out of stock” and there will be no “cheap” substitutes. Amazon owes it to their customers to maintain some quality control. Instead they are stocking many, very many substitutes that did not exist before. Also, they have allowed the price on “junk” to go through the roof. Read the review, the comments on these outrageously priced & newly appearing Chinese made hand sanitizers. It is absolutely nothing but a rip-off. Amazon should start listing items as “sold out” & stop aiding these companies with no quality control in flooding our markets with overpriced garbage. It is Amazon’s good name that will suffer. We expect Amazon to do at least a little policing of the products they sell, and prices that have quadrupled in a month’s time. I hope the Amazon name will mean as much “post” covid-19 as it did “pre” covid-19!!!;US

They don't care that my money is gone and the product is way over due.Amazon may contact the vendor, maybe file an A to Z complaint and another month goes by and Amazon has my money. I don’t know if I have to contact Amazon again to make this happen. Amazon could have read the complaints from all the other people who have not gotten the product, but chose not to.Amazon has removed this item from their site like the other 2 items I had the same issue with.I told Amazon I would file a dispute with my bank and they said, go ahead file a dispute with you bank.This is the third time something like this has happened.

The other issue is a little more philosophical I suppose but amazon has kind of become a monopoly and is putting a lot of smaller companies out of business.;US

It seems that when they went to their own delivery system and started to promise 1 day deliveries, that the issues have happened. Several item have been lost in shipping.At least 1 of the items was bought and fulfilled by Amazon. 1st item got lost, I got a refund because item was no longer available,and ordered a similar item. 2nd item got lost. Called customer service which issued a re-shipping order which did nothing. After several more days I got on their help center.Went through 4 customer service people. At that point I was so disgusted that I told them I lost faith in the system. They recommend that I order from a different vendor at $10.00 more for the same item and that they would pay the expedited shipping. I told them that the $10.00 more was the expedited shipping cost and that I did not feel that I should pay for their problem. They said when I get my item, I should ask for a refund of the difference. We'll see how it works out.Later,I did order the other part and did contact them once I received it. I also copied and pasted from the previous chat that I had saved so it was per their instructions being fed back to them. They not only issued a refund but also refunded the whole amount of the purchase. I guess they knew I was upset. I think I'm back on track with them.;US

My personal card was charged on my company's business account for Prime. So I called in and the rep told me he would refund my card and give me prime for free for the next year. Sounds nice, right? Next thing I know, the prime membership on the company is canceled! I call in and they say the rep promised me something they can't fulfill (she will send a message to his manager to make sure he knows this for the future.. gee thanks) and he also canceled my membership, but ""no worries"" you can just sign up again on the sign up page. So about the promise, I argued with the rep saying a company such as Amazon should stand behind what their reps, even if the rep made a mistake. We had it out for a few minutes until she said she can offer me a partial promotional credit to my account for compensation. It was almost the full amount so I consented. About the continued membership, ""no worries, just sign up from your end because we can't do it from our end."" Oh, but when I go to the sign up page, the price for business prime is now $179 and we were paying $119! Even after emailing and complaining that I got into this mess from a rep that made a bad mistake, it's not my fault that my membership was cancelled and if it hadn't been I would be still paying the lower rate, every rep who emails me just tells me the same thing: Our terms changed and we ""offer Business Prime Memberships for Business Account where the customers can simply make purchases and avail two-day free shipping. This completely for a free shipping purpose and the other benefits of prime will not be given."" Sounds like it should be cheaper, right? $60 more than standard prime for personal accounts. Not getting anywhere with Amazon and very frustrated with ""Earth's Most Customer-Centric Company.""**After calling back and asking to speak with a manager, I was able to sign up again for the business prime and he will refund me for the difference of $60 this one time. He said as of next year standard prime will no longer be available for business accounts so then I will have to make my decision but for now, he gave me the lower rate for Business prime.

Two-day delivery is bs.  I’ve had several two-day delivery packages be delayed.  One was a birthday present for my 6 year old nephew.  We postponed leaving until the next morning because Amazon said the delivery would be there in two days.  Right at the 9pm end of day delivery mark, Amazon sends a shipment delay note saying it may not be for another 5 days.  The tracking showed it was in my city.  Why would that take 5 days?!  Im beginning to wonder what I pay this membership for.  The two day shipping has gone to the wayside, and I’m beginning to not believe in Amazon’s promise any more...or the quality of the products sold.  Don’t say you can do something if you can’t.  False advertising, Amazon.  Maybe I should take my membership to Walmart, Amazon.  What do you think about that?  I’m not a fan, but they seem to be getting themselves squared away to be completion.;US

XPO Logistics was supposed to deliver it last Saturday. The drivers lied saying they knocked on the door. I waited all day thinking they were still coming. I received an email at 4 pm that night saying they tried to deliver but no one was home. I have two dogs that would have alerted me if someone was at the door.Then when I called to complain that they never tried to deliver the package the people on the phone where rude. Additionally, I found out they had my phone number wrong. I asked them to change it but I was told they couldn't change the number, I had to contact Amazon to have the number changed. The supervisor even refused to change the number or help me plus she was rude. ""You didn't see a big truck pull up in front of your house "". My bedroom are in the front of the house not my living area so how would I see them pull up to the house.I called Amazon and changed my number plus let them know I was unhappy with the delivery provider. Amazon changed my number in the system. By Wednesday I still had not received a call to deliver the playhouse. So I called to find out why. The lady on the phone was actually helpful. She explained they where calling the wrong number despite the notes in the system giving the correct phone number. She actually changed my number so the organization could contact me when they were delivering.Today I was given another 4 hour window. I called to try and find a smaller window explaining I have things I need to get done (the stuff I couldn't get done last weekend because I waited all day). Again the lady on the line was rude and unhelpful.If you order something and find that this company will be delivering it. I suggest you find the product somewhere else.

Not possible anymore as far as I can tell,  I've spent the last 30 minutes trying to break through the Barrier - getting nowhere.  I am advised by robo-service that even though they've said it's delivered... it may take up to 36 hours for it to actually be delivered.

Also my husband got a few months of kindle unlimited for free, and I have found that any book that I have shared with my husband he cannot read because they will not download.

5d1028aab055990790ebbdc1;Responsiveness of giants among us;43640;3;I've been ordering from Amazon Prime for about 3 or more yrs. Now with the usual mis delivered items but In the last year it has been getting worse.Now they have this new thing when they deliver your package they send you a picture of your back porch. Trouble is, it's not always your porch. I have pointed this out several times but they'd rather shine you On with an obligatory sorry and a couple of bucks. Not to mention you pay an additional $119. for Prime -  1 to 2 day shipping . This week I ordered And promised my 5 yr. Old granddaughter a Dodger hat, glove, and 2 balls by Wednesday. Wrong. Wrong porch. Told them and said send driver lbackout to get and redilever. Nope, too easy, will resend. Another two days. Hat came in mail, thank goodness. Promised my granddaughter a Dodger hat n ball to help make up for it. Supposed to get Friday. Wrong again. Same porch, not mine. Sent text as soon as I got the picture and quite aggravated now with a crying granddaughter i immediately send a text to send driver back out now and pick up my items and deliver to me. That didn't happen. Next day I find the obligatory sorry again. Was quite upset by now and have to take nitroglycerin tabs for the chest pains they created and let them know it too. So needless to say, no reply, no baseball no bat and no resolution. Could that driver live there or know someone there?? Does that person need glasses??? I'm my opinion Amazon condones the theft of packages not belonging to addresses not to mention opening other people's mail. Found out open someone's mail from your mailbox. It's a federal pffense. You give it back. I guess when you get that big you can treat common people however you want. They should remember when they weren't so big and who helped them get there. I'm a big Dodger can having been born in NYC. First game I went to and only games were Brooklyn Dodgers. Now we carry the torch for LA Dodgers. This is so disappointing how they treat people. Thank you Trustpilot, for listening.  And here it is Monday and you guessed it. No bat, no ball no response,no consideration for the consumer. Why would you think I ordered that. To see someone else get it. So much for 20 + years in the military. My husband fought in Korean war and two tours in Vietnam and he can't even get our 5/6 year old granddaughter some Dodger stuff. Guess that's a thank you for your service we'll not soon forget. But don't waste any time collecting that $119. Prime membership. Soery, yes, we're quite upset.;US

I tried dealing with the customer service reps to resolve with no success, so I filed a fraud alert on my credit card. Since then this has happened twice more, Yesterday I chatted online with the customer service rep who informed me there was nothing they could do to stop these unwanted transactions. After 39 minutes of trying to reason with them that there must be a way to stop it, I realized I must be now part of Rod Sterling's program, The Twilight Zone. In frustration I called the credit card company and cancelled the card since as long as they had the number on file they just kept adding the gift reloads for $100 and then sending two $50 play stations which depleted my gift card which they then reloaded which created another order for pay stations. After cancelling the card they informed me I needed to contact them with new credit information. Really?

But there are these aggravating issues: (1) Their auto packing tosses items into one huge box, frequently with insufficient packing materials, and I have had so many broken items I no longer order items such as prime pantry (2) Because they do put as much as possible in one box it is frequently too heavy for me to handle and is frequently put in front of my door so I cannot open the door and have to walk around the house to move it to the other side, which any sensible delivery person would realize (3) Amazon's newer delivery service that I guess is avoid using the post office involves a number of different carriers, some of which are so poor that I have to call customer service...once because an item was just tossed into a snow bank on my driveway, another when it was tossed onto a dark driveway where it was smashed, or I suddenly got a notice that no one was there to accept the package and I NEVER changed from unattended package instructions (4) sometimes the delivery person leaves the package at my back door, where it does not occur to me to search for packages, so sometimes it is there for a few days before I realize it was delivered (5)when you are expected to say why you are returning an item you get a list of options that for me have seldom included any item connected with why I am returning it so I just mark off any one of them and hope for the best (5) if you ever get an email address or phone no. for Amazon customer service cling onto it because if you try to get that by an inquiry on the Amazon search you will never find it there.  All of these negatives have led to my checking with EBay now and ordering there when they have the same products, which increasingly they do.;US

5cfa786ab055990790e3bf08;PACKAGING;43623;3;Amazon must get through a vast amount of packaging which ends up in our bins.

5ced4619a843690ac8c55f52;Too much counterfeiting;43613;3;I use Amazon all the time, but will always pick another retailer when reasonable. Their fulfillment system is too easily exploited by counterfeiters. Anyone can use their fulfillment system, and all items are combined together. When a retailer sells through Amazon (including Amazon itself), they pull an item from their shelf. Could be a counterfeit someone sent in or a legit item. You don't know.With more traditional retailers online, you know they buy their stock from reliable distributors so you know for sure you are getting the item/brand you paid for.;US

5cd8bb7da8436908c4170d33;Their delivery has gone from “the best” to amateur night;43598;3;I had been a faithful Amazon customer since the 1990s and rarely had cause for dissatisfaction, until they started using their own couriers. Unlike UPS or FEDEX, who assign you the same driver week-in, week-out, Amazon seems to be assigning pure duffers who have no experience in delivery. Instead of leaving my packages where I want (outside or inside my garage door), they might dump a 40lb. package onto the day lilies surrounding my mail post—on the curb, 50 yards from my home—or on my back patio, or at my laundry room door, BECAUSE AMAZON HAS NO SYSTEM FOR ME TO REQUEST A PREFERENCE! It’s amateur night whenever they deliver! Their people don’t know me, I don’t know them, and they have ruined a number of my deliveries by leaving them out in the rain without so much as a plastic wrapper for protection. Worst of all, there is no way for me to lodge a complaint except here. Now I try to order ABA: Anywhere But Amazon.;US

I've been using Amazon since 2006 and would consider myself a dedicated customer. There are lot of items for sale and it's very easy to find them. However it literally can cause me anxiety waiting for a delivery or wondering whether I'd even get my delivery. I've had experiences where the delivery drivers don't bother knocking or they've left my package in a communal area. I even got £5 compensation one time because of their lazy approach to delivery. I now try to mitigate this by using Prime and selecting the precise date on which I want delivery. But that's too much of an onus on a customer.;GB

Each time I deal with a customer representative I am satisfied with the results however, this new delivery system they have is faulty. I order and pay money to have a service that guarantees a delivery but because they hire self employed lazy drivers I dont get my stuff as promised. I dont mind waiting, if that's what the item I am buying states but if it says it will be here on a Tuesday then I expect it to be here on a Tuesday. I pay 100+ a year to have this service. 4 stops and 5 miles away from my home the driver decides to mark the package with ""attempted"" delivery. I called Amazon and filed a report and they could see the driver was no where near my residence at time of ""attempted"" scan. If you take on a job, do it, or you shouldn't get paid. This kind of misuse of Amazon's time and customer complaints will eventually end up in the consumer pocket since Amazon will lose money hiring lazy drivers.";US
5c72b6aa97afa1097076af50;Amazon, Absolutely no quality reference;43520;3;Sorry to say that 3´rd party sellers hide behind the fact that Amazon does not want to be involved in their sales and the quality of it. Amazon, in my view act similar to a fence. When someone sells something so bad, such as the quality of a CD film, how can you as a private buyer stop them from selling more junk to the public ?This type of sellers don´t want any ratings, so from there they are protected from further scam. When the item had been sold for a low price the you completely loose in the transaction as you don´t want to be involved in a return fight where you absolutely don´t know wher it will stop. Amazon gives strong indication that they do not care selling such low quality items as it is impossible to contact them and with no rating activated for the seller, there is not much you can do and impossible to warn others.;DE

5c4bbdf397afa10ac0832ef0;Amazon is anti-customer friendly;43491;3;I think that these are the main core main issues of Amazon that makes Amazon anti-customer friendly.1) Want to use Amazon Prime Now? Sadly, you don't get free delivery, you have to first spend $35 or more to get free 2 hour delivery. If not, they'll charge you $4.99 for delivery. Why can't it be free no matter the cost? Membership cost is ridiculous, but yet, it's not free or maybe $0.99.2) Prime Video app does not support 'Chromecast' so that we can cast shows and movies to TV's. We're expected to watch content on our phones but we can't control what we do, even though membership cost is ridiculous.;US

BUT, BUT, BUT - I do not like Bezos' politics and I hate making him richer. I hate the fact that Amazon is still streaming NRA TV. But that aside the organization has internal problems. The shipping dept is LOUSY and must be poorly run. One in four packages we receive are poorly packed, have no bubbly wrap to protect the products or poorly boxed and shipped. This probably has to do with the volume they are processing BUT they need more personnel if it is not being done right. Where are the supervisors? My guess is that no one is paid what they should be paid to work or supervise at the company. Another reason to hate Bezos and his only interest being seemingly in profit and the bottom line and not in the customers' experiences. Typical corporate America.

They have removed the stress and risks of buying goods for me and I now receive a few parcels a week from them. In the rare cases when there are issues contacting customer service quickly resolves them.Update from my original 5 star review. Amazon have become more aggressive as they seek to monetise their high market share. Alexa continually tries to sell you more services (you cannot stop this) to the point of ruining the user experience and has today signed me up for an audible subscription it offered my six year old and she declined  (Alexa has the recording DON’T sign me up).Customer service now don’t offer email and the chat use literally two hours of life I’ll never get back refusing to acknowledge the issue or allow me to raise a complaint.

They repeat back something completely different from what you tell them.  The other issue I have with customer service, is that if you ask a question about a product because the details are a bit confusing, they give you completely incorrect information.It's a shame Amazon doesn't hire competant customer service reps, so that their customers don't have such major frustration every time they speak to one.;US

Sometimes it is worth it and other times it is not, like when you order a package that says it's prime, then it doesn't show up until a week later. Which has happened multiple times, to the point that I have cancelled several orders for the fact that I knew I was either never getting the item or would never get it for what I was paying for prime to get it to me in a specific timeframe.Ease of access to the pick up items in one day is convenient, but eases of access to such items on the site is rather discouraging.Main thing they need to fix is labeling items as prime that they know good and well will not be shipped in a 2 day or less timeframe. Also the one day shipping fee is a joke.Honestly their conduct of service is only pushing me back to Ebay, who has stepped up their game as far as shopping/shipping and giving a reliable user experience is concerned.;US

Very customer centric but there are, at times, moments when you have to push your complaints further.

Amazon needs to either have all listings separate, or all grouped under one listing, not randomly broken up.I've only made a handful of purchases over the years. About half the time there are problems. Amazon support is terrible, and every time they've never read what I wrote, giving a hilariously irrelevant reply. They refund things in the end, but it's not worth the hassle.They always try to upsell their Prime service, and keep selecting the wrong shipping address out of the two I ship to.

5b9a76118c83fd0b58d78dd7;Amazon is going downhill;43356;3;"Amazon is going downhill.  Don't get me wrong, I'm not going to ""dump Amazon Prime"" like others suggest.  I'm simply going to deal with them cautiously.My first complaint is their search algorithm.  Last night, I was looking for watches.  Amazon's initial search returned over 10,000 results.  I didn't want to wade through 10,000 result so I decided to change the sort from [Default] to [Price Low to High].  I didn't narrow the search in ANY way.The new results dropped to 100.  I literally lost over 9,900 purchase options.  I was forced to go back to the previous search results and wade through a ton of crap that was of no interest to me.  It literally too me a half hour to find a Timex watch that should have shown up on the low end of prices when I changed the sort order but it was eliminated in those results.  What the hell is that???My next complaint is that they've changed their ""Two Day Shipping"" policy.  I understand that this change occurred some time ago but the point is that you have to pay attention to WHEN the item ships.  Two days is no longer calculated from the date of order but from the date of ship.  In some cases, shipping won't occur for a couple of weeks!My third complaint is that their customer service used to be automatic.  They would take responsibility when things went wrong and they'd offer a resolution without even being asked.  Today, getting Amazon to take responsibility for broken promises is like pulling teeth.  I used to give them 5 stars for customer service but today, I'd be hard pressed to give them anything more than 2.5.Bottom line.  Amazon is no longer the go-to for me and I shop around before placing ANY orders there.  Besides finding better pricing in other places, there are many browser add-ons and apps that offer me additional savings or money back on my purchases with other retailers.I would have given them 2 stars but I do get some use out of the included streaming benefit.";US

I thought that’s what the review was for.  Ultimately I did receive the item after another couple of weeks. Don’t trust all the reviews, because amazon isn’t letting the negative ones be posted.;US

I believe that this type of outlet should develop a format to introduce new entries to their published list, and to maintain such rooster continually for up to 90 days after posting of a new book title, (even at a small cost to the authors is acceptable). Doing so, does not translate to an endorsement of a book, rather informative to the audiences worldwide. The AMAZON prominence position them to champion this option. Because the idea of listing a book title on their portal, without publicity, is like planting a flower without intention to add water for germination. Development of ""AMAZON BookTV"" where such is platformed is no a bad idea considering the corporate standard.";US

5761ebe70000ff00096690d0;Amazon Prime shipping;42536;3;I haven't been very happy with the Amazon Prime Service for a while now.   I mainly use prime for shipping.  Not for free movies and books.  When I contacted them about service I got a small credit and a story about warehouses in strategic locations for expedited shipping.  Really don't care about how many warehouses they have or if they have to swap stock items between warehouses.  I order something, then I expect it delivered in 2 or 3 days because I paid for prime shipping.  End of story to me.  Not Amazon's story.  I have repeatedly had to navigate their site to send a message regarding delivery.  Normally their shipping and delivery estimates are off I am waiting and waiting for my item to be processed then shipped.  The waiting 3 5 or 6 days on them to ship something and then see it expedited doesn't make me happy..  Well, what bothers me is that because their swapping between warehouses isn't my fault, but the checkout button says I can pay more to have stuff shipped when it becomes available.  I already paid for prime.  So when I order 4 things in 1 cart order - my entire orders sits.  I started making separate orders for a while and then often I needed something that is a +$25 add on item.  Just tired over amazon's game.;US

I find an item on Amazon, and find the exact seller and same item on EBAY for much less.  I tried to open a store on Amazon, it did not go so well.  Our money was held for a very long time (we did not get paid for months) and what we here this is the norm.  We also listed my Company phone number (expensive items) so customers could call to confirm we were the real deal. Most were asking for our number from Amazon, as customers of high end item want to Many want to talk to a human, not a computer.  Amazon did not like this, gave us a hard time, so we no longer sell on Amazon. Amazon is good for sellers of low cost items that are somewhat standard, easy to spot a consumer, not high end or custom items that consumers want to discuss before a purchase.

56abb45f0000ff00093572ef;Be aware, some things are amazing, others...;42398;3;I love amazon for their books, their prime, customer service, and their amazing deals. 5 stars pretty much all around. Howver, regarding boots, shoes, and some other goods:While shopping for boots have you ever noticed the same model of the same brand is said to run big on one site, small on another, get 5 stars here, or three stars there? People from one site swear by this brand or this style, others have nothing but complaints? I have been in the re-sale business of shoes for several years now and have noticed several interesting quirks when researching and reselling shoes. The era of 6pm and Amazon have (unfortunately) created loopholes for customers who think they can count on a brand name (even Frye, Keen, Sorel, etc) for quality. 6pm and Amazon frequently (if not always) sell cheaper low quality versions. For example: The boots you buy from the company are all leather with a leather sole and welted construction (sole sewn to the boot) for example, but Amazon's are glued together with rubber soles. Full grain leathers are used on the company's boots, split leathers are used on the others. I don't know why the brand's allow for this blatant misuse of their names and logos (except that it must be profitable), but be aware that what you are buying through these companies will not last and is not the quality you may be expecting.;US
56894cd20000ff00092b7df1;Great variety;42372;3;I use amazon a lot, especially around the holidays. My husband has prime shipping, so most items arrive within 2 to 3 days. I have had some problems with some returns--not getting a full refund on products on I returned because of the seller's policy. I had some difficulties with a merchant this Christmas, but the merchant handled the problem to my satisfaction. You just have to be careful that the merchant does not charge a restocking or return fee, especially if the mistake was the merchant's fault. My husband ordered an item from a seller on amazon and it was defective. When he contacted the company, they sent him a return address label but it was not prepaid, so we had to pay the shipping fee to return it. I told him he should have refused to pay for return shipping since the item was defective, and he needs to mention that in his review of the seller. Overall, though, I have had mostly positive experiences with amazon and will continue to use them. You can find almost any type of item on amazon, which makes shopping with them very convenient.;US
56610f810000ff000920816c;Don't Get Prime;42342;3;I believe Amazon is a great company and  offers fantastic products for fantastic prices. However, that being said Amazon Prime is terrible. It offers less options than Netflix (by far). The free kindle rental offers a wide selection of books you've never heard of before while restricting any popular book series to purchase only. To top it all off the free 2-day shipping has been horrendous. Out of my last 10 orders, 4 of them have not made it by the day they promised. I have called customer service every time and they have simply said, it will be there tomorrow. It's a GUARANTEE. Yet they act like it's no big deal that your shipment isn't going to make it by the time they promised. (Which in reality they typically give themselves a day for processing too so it turns out to be closer to 3 days anyway but it's still late). So unless you plan on buying a fair number of order less than $25 save the money.;US

So when I got the shipment it was obviously shattered to pieces. I called Amazon because I wanted to return it, I didn't want to deal with the mess and I was told that it was a liability for them to get it back from me. But it was ok for ME to get broken glass? I don't think so! So after I talked to the customer service rep and tell him/her about proper ways to ship items they offered me a new shipment of the same item. I was not happy. <<<< Fast forward 2 days later >>>> I get the new shipment in the mail. And yes, it was BROKEN, AGAIN! Shattered to small pieces, made nothing! So again I'm on the phone with someone in customer service who can't really change anything in the warehouse wanted to send me a replacement! I just asked for my money back and called it a day.For an e-commerce company that deals with so many products, they did not a very good job at properly packaging the glass items.

Looked at questions answered also, stating the door was reversible. I took a minute to search by model number and there was ONE review on this model. The site clumped 13 different models, including outmoded ones, into one set of reviews making the reviews misleading and useless. It arrived in one day - door is no way reversible on THIS EXACT model. Luckily we don't care except I don't like being misled. This is not the first time I've discovered this practice - check out Amazon purchaser reviews of Panasonic NNT-945SF Microwave or Green Mountain Nantucket Blend K-Cups.

A few times it seems lately they would mess up my order, the first time oik it was fine but than the second time I am thinking what is going on... I called customer service and they told me there having problem with my address. I am thinking well you never had any other issues before. They did not give me a straight answer as to why.;CA
5475e6a50000640002b72f62;Not bad, not good;41969;3;I found some good deals on Amazon, but also waited weeks to get those. Customer service is meh, they don`t really care about your orders;US
544ae4d80000640002aed8e1;Shipping is too high;41936;3;I love shopping at Amazon, but the one thing I hate about shopping there is there extremely HIGH shipping fees. Sometimes shipping can range to be 8 to 16 dollars alone! But, you can find almost everything on Amazon, except don't do your grocery shopping there for food, it will cost you sometimes triple and more then it would cost you to just buy food form a normal in-store grocery shop.;US
53ecb76000006400029eb049;Not bad, but not great;41865;3;I found some great deals, but also had terrible experience with customer service. I`m also against businesses that use monopolist tactics, so there`s that.;US

536c73ef000064000288cb36;Postal Service destroying Amazon;41768;3;I have been a Prime members since its introduction in 2005 and have been buying almost exclusively on Amazon and Myhabit. I never had a problem until Amazon started using USPS. Out of many USPS deliveries only one was delivered on time! Not only that - the Postal Service lies and claims that shipments were delivered a day or two before they actually are. USPS delivery people don't bother making few steps to check whether you are at home and leave notice so that you have to go to the post office to pick up the shipment. This makes Prime a frustrating experience. Teaming up with the USPS was a big mistake, and may end up costing Amazon in a big way.;US
5338a93400006400028083df;Not so happy with Amazon anymore;41728;3;"I used to be a faithful buyer from Amazon, they used to be my first stop when shopping, but no more.  They raised the minimum purchase for ""SuperSaver Shipping"" from $25 to $35, making it tougher to save money on shipping costs.  Then they started charging sales tax, which adds 7% to the cost of anything I buy from Amazon.  I no longer stop at Amazon first to buy as they always seem to be a more expensive place to shop.  It is a shame Amazon, I spent a bundle at your store in the past, but no more!";US
5314d5b500006400027ada6f;Free shipping is INTENTIONALLY, and unreasonably slow;41701;3;It has become very obvious that Amazon intentionally delays their free shipping, probably so people upgrade shipping methods and pay more.  I just recently ordered something they have in stock sold from amazon, and was told it would ship from amazon a week(7days) later. What is up with that? Two days later I cancelled my amazon order, ordered from somewhere else(shipped same day), and still got my package delivered 3 days before amazon was to even ship it! You can read all about this on amazons own forum, hundreds of people wondering WHY amazon has become so slow past couple years.  All i can say is im not going to wait if better service is out there for basically same price, people will catch on, and go somewhere else, naturally.;US

509b014900006400022d2399;Amazon;41221;3;I have used Amazon in the past with no shopping problems. Recently, however, I tried selling one of my college books back to them through their book buyback program.

A little upset with the whole experience, but I still like Amazon overall.;US
50986e0600006400022cdde6;Generally Good Service More Ethical Products Please!;41219;3;Although I have been happy with Amazon's service and prompt delivery I noticed recently that they still sell real fur in some of their lines and make up brushes, as most fur is imported from China and former Soviet States with animals skinned alive, electrocuted and very much abused I do not think that such a popular site should have these items on its site, please consider an ethical overhaul of some product lines;GB
4ffde7e50000640002225399;Very easy to use but multiple deliveries are a pain !!;41101;3;The site provides a huge selection and prices are usually competitive.

4feb1ecb0000640002212598;Ridiculous amount of packaging!;41087;3;Every time I order I'm left with tons of Packaging to dispose of!Their super saver delivery service has significantly slowed down since I first started shopping with them.Pricing is good on the whole but often find stuff cheaper elsewhere and recently sent price notice for a microwave that was £30 cheaper on another site (with free next day delivery!) but got no response.Obviously I bought it from the other retailer but would have preferred Amazon due to their easy return process.;GB

But no normal bookshop or retail operation would survive if it only sold what people could identify and name on their shopping list: there is a razor sharp focus in the search engine, but the spontaneous browsing element is all but absent.Sorry guys, but readers often buy books that are shelved by topic near what we thought we might have bought at the outset, if we ever had a title or author to start with.;GB

4f4255a7000064000217fe0e;Great for DVDs/Blu-Ray and Books;40959;3;Seeing Amazon grow over the years has been great to see the expansion in available items and its great to go to one place for many different types of goods. The problem with Amazon is that when you have faulty goods or problems they arent always very helpful. I had a hardware fault which was an inherent manufacturer defect but Amazon said i had no rights to claim a repair or replacement from them (They say the Sale of goods act is a load of rubbish) i had to go through the courts in the end to get them to deal with my faulty goods. Also bad if you have to return damaged goods, its at your own expense and in most cases they dont even pay back the cost of your postage charges of recorded delivery so the item is traceable in the mail.Not a good way for a company to work.;GB

Instead they have something which is over complicated and annoying. For example the BIZARRE system they implement with the postage fees and the various levels of sellers which you have to be high up on to be able to even OFFER *free* postage?!I don't like buying from Amazon market place either.

I settled for paying the extra cost for shipping to get it here on time, but may just stick to craigslist, eBay, or half.com for my next purchase.;US
4ee638c5000064000212a9d6;Good website, but only if there are no problems.;40889;3;Generally a good website and i love they fact they have almost everything i could ever want.  The Marketplace facility is also a great thing.  Generally delivery is very, very quick (i have received some things within 24 hours of ordering with normal delivery), but have had some problems trying to get things sorted when things have gone wrong.My big problem at the moment is my Kindle which failed.  It is a covered under warranty, but because i bought it at Atlanta airport while i was transiting, it has to be replaced in America.  As i don't live there, or have family/friends who do, it has meant having the replacement sent to a friend of a friend who will then send it to me.  Not exactly ideal, and i will still need to pay the costs to have it shipped from the US to Europe.  I also have to pay those costs to have the old one sent back (although i'm assuming these will be reimbursed).  This to me is a ridiculous system for an international company the size of Amazon.  They could easily have sorted it out to be sent to Europe, or be sent from a European warehouse, or even taken up my offer of paying any difference in price between the European model and the US one.  It's all a bit of a farce.;NL
