I contacted ASOS customer service 3 times over 3 weeks and was told it had been referred to their ?€?specialist?€? team and to wait for an email. Not once did I hear from them again. After 3 or 4 weeks I registered a dispute through AfterPay. ASOS failed to respond to the dispute and AfterPay then refunded me all monies paid. ASOS did not once acknowledge the order existed, despite receiving payment. All my previous orders have worked out well. I?€?d suggest if you buy from them never pay them direct, always through a reliable third party. I?€?m deleting the App and will never buy from them again.",AU,Rated 1 out of 5 stars

I was told rest assured the package would arrive within 2 working days. I have now not received the package and I am now advised that it will arrive in 10 working days meaning I am without a Christmas present for a loved one and now need to go out shopping on Christmas Eve.

Adam Machado-Gibbs,"December 28, 2022",Endless customer service failures and lies. I feel sorry for them as they are all trained to follow something that is not genuine.,"I have been chasing an order for over a month that was next day delivery, and what has become clear after 18 customer service chats is that a script is followed that is not genuine. When you are told a failed order has been reprocessed, they are saying that before it actually has. Two customer service representatives had to admit the previous person had lied. For almost 5 weeks I have been told by the rep they will personally take care of this and as a customer themselves they understand fully - they all say this exact wording. It is not true, and when I am told I will hear from someone I never do. If the order fails, the only way you find out is by chasing once again. This is now the sixth failure, the presents missed Christmas, but the worst part is the lies by customer service. I feel sorry for them as I know they are following a template put out by ASOS, but it means I can never use this company again.",US,Rated 1 out of 5 stars

When I received the jacket, it was obviously fake. It was thin, no Berghaus tags or labels on the jacket at all. Visually, it was completely different and the pockets had been sewn into the inside of the coat. There were no toggles etc?€? I decided to send the jacket back and ASOS rejected my return, claiming that the ?€?item the warehouse received was not the item that was sent to me?€?. I received the coat back a few days later, and have obviously opened a fraud investigation as this is highly illegal and I believe I am owed a full refund and possibly compensation. Whether this is ASOS?€?s doing or workers in the warehouse, you must be so careful. I highly recommend buying branded items directly from their own websites and checking the items you receive for authenticity codes and tags. I was lucky enough to be sent a counterfeit item that was completely different and smelt horrendous, so I could tell instantly but some counterfeits are very cleverly made and you wouldn?€?t realise the item was fake unless you looked into it. Please be careful everyone and if anyone else has a similar experience, any advice on how you solved this issue would be great! Thank you",GB,Rated 1 out of 5 stars

That?€?s clearly fraud because they?€?re now accepting that it?€?s lost in transit. So was it delivered to the patch of grass in the photo with two white pipes or was it never even on the van to be delivered? I can of course back this up with evidence if requested. I?€?m reevaluating how much I really need to use ASOS anymore. Certainly as long as they continue their relationship with EVRI.

Furthermore, when items are missing of delivery or when deliveries seem to always be stalled - without any update for weeks upon weeks - there is no UK customers service/managers to 'put things right'. Instead, we have to type it up for people outside of the UK. This will never win my confidence!!

Should ASOS, therefore, be considered as not CARING for its OWN CUSTOMERS?PS: I only just got a REFUND today - 28 December 2022. In addition, I dare not re-Order these items as ASOS has yet to show an understanding for the importance of business relationships with customers by REASSURING said customers about whether delivery services with EVRI has improved(?).

Eventually got a refund from ASOS but that was difficult to do.Delivery 2: I re-ordered the one that never arrived and although I have the next day delivery, was given an expected date 3 days in future. This parcel was late too. On the day it was being delivered, I was given a time slot which it was 2 hours late for. By this time I had left my house and had expected it to be a no show!

The rep then said once the carrier was in receipt of the return they could expedite a refund. I totally understood that.

At 3am on 22/12/2022 ASOS were contacted as the jeans had not been delivered and a refund was sought. It transpired that ASOS?€?s courier took a picture of a parcel and this required investigation. Irrespective of the Consumer Rights Act s28 and s29 that explicitly explain that delivery must be to the buyer, ASOS believes themselves to be above the law and refused to refund me for a parcel that only the courier had seen.  Asos then asked for two days to investigate. They had this, but again refused to refund my money. Despite explaining that the items were no longer wanted - the person to whom these would have been a gift has left the country and we are on holiday - ASOS insists that they require more time to deliver. Irrespective of telling them that nobody would be in they insisted that they couldn?€?t refund until after the 26/12/2022. 26/12/2022 came and went, no refund.

Having been a customer for a long time and had great service to been on the receiving end the past few months of some simply shocking episodes. The most recent an order placed on 14/12 with next day delivery due through premier delivery. Well as you have probably guessed asos decided to send this via EVRI so even now as I write this review (24/12) the parcel has not arrived. Spoke to asos through their chat system and was told on 20/12 that a message would be sent to EVRI to chase up my parcel and if I hadn?€?t heard anything by 22/12 to contact them back and either a refund or replacement would be issued. Nothing received so on the 23/12 I contacted asos again however this time was told I had to leave it until cob that day and to contact them on 24/12 if no update received and again I would be either given a refund of replacement. I contacted the online chat again today and was told I now need to leave it until 01/01/2023 and if the parcel doesn?€?t arrive I can then contact asos and they will arrange a refund. So basically I have to wait 18 days before I can be given a refund on the off chance that EVRI decide to deliver my parcel. Apparently you cannot log a complaint through asos despite the website saying to contact the chat facility to log a complaint and the colleagues on the chat might as well just not answer as it?€?s utterly useless. I?€?ve ended up requesting a chargeback through my bank so I would expect asos to be receiving notification of this shortly. If anyone from asos is reading these reviews then I would advise that some major changes need to be made as fromWhat I have been seeing you are loosing customers through the sheer lack of customer service at a rate of knots.,GB,Rated 1 out of 5 stars

Ann,"December 31, 2022",WILL STOP USING ASOS due to EVRI (used to be Hermes),"WILL STOP PURCHASING FROM ASOS UK if they continue to use EVRI (used to be called Hermes) as their parcel delivery provider.www. thesun.co.uk / money/20783365 / evri-customers-poor-service /(you need to get rid of the spaces in the above to be able to read the article)Made a large order on 26th December 2022 with ASOS UK with premium customer therefore next day delivery service paid for.  On the EVRI parcel tracking service the parcel is out for delivery.  Granted I would have been understanding for the parcel arriving one day late or maybe two, however, 5 days later have not received it. On contacting ASOS they have said that I need to give EVRI 2 days (48 hours) to investigate which means 7 days and still no parcel delivered.  All ASOS can offer is a refund (customers want the items ASOS that's why they paid for them) or a discount code which to be honest, there is always discount codes on all the time and this can't be used in conjunction with them therefore ASOS is not offering any compensation at all whatsoever for not fulfilling its contractual duty to those who purchase premium membership. What is the benefit of doing so?It was a large order and I really needed some of the items to arrive today.Well, it seems the good ole days of ASOS have gone - no telephone number to contact customer service, ASOS using most likely the cheapest most dreadful parcel delivery company they can find, EVRI who used to be known as HERMES with a very bad track record and then, to top it off, offer a premium customer with a discount code which they already always offer discounts practically every other day on their site.Although the ASOS customer service chat agent was polite and very understanding as one could be (that is where I have given them the one star for) it still falls to ASOS as a company to look at what delivery service they are providing to their customers.  Profits come before the customers otherwise they would use a more reliable parcel service provider than EVRI. What happened to DPD - more reliable but EVRI undercutting them in price so you go with EVRI? Negative reviews about EVRI and ASOS using them seem to be growing by the day.  Had I read the reviews before I purchased I would have purchased these items elsewhere.I will update in the next few days on the service I have received for paying for ASOS premier service and whether EVRI have lost (? - must choose ones words carefully. Hermes, the courier firm was marred by allegations that its drivers mishandled parcels and therefore a reason to rebrand to EVRI. Has anything changed but the name?) this large parcel of items.I wish I had read these review and others before purchasing items from ASOS at this crucial time. I think I will have to stop buying from any online company that uses EVRI (previously HERMES) as their parcel delivery agent as rebranding hasn't changed their dreadful service.  Please ASOS don't let EVRI keep tarnishing your brand. On rebranding from Hermes to EVRI your managing director said ""This is more than just a name change ?€? it is a statement of intent of our commitment to leading the way in creating responsible delivery experiences for 'Evri one', 'Evri where',"" he said. ""It heralds a new culture and an even better way of doing things in an ever-evolving world, building on our achievements and successes.""Unfortunately is this is not reflecting reality for many of your customers.",US,Rated 1 out of 5 stars

After waiting a couple of weeks for an item I'd purchased, I contacted customer support and was assured that this would be chased up for me and that I'd receive an update within 2 working days (I didn't). When I contacted customer support for the second time, I was given the same advice again, and so therefore decided to request that the order be cancelled and for a replacement to be sent out. I was advised that I would receive an update/confirmation of this within 2 working days, but I heard nothing (again). When I contacted customer support for the 3rd time I was advised that the matter would be chased up and to wait another couple if days, but I was not prepared to accept the same advice once more. I therefore requested that my order be cancelled and for a refund to be issued, with the intention of placing a new seperate order in a bid to get the item delivered in time for christmas. I then explained that the item I had purchased had since increased in price since I'd initially bought it, and that I would now also have to pay the next day delivery cost on top of this to ensure that my gift arrived in time. I enquired whether it would be possible to provide me with a discount code to allow me to re-purchase the item at the price I'd originally paid, and/or for a code for next day delivery, save additional money going from my account whilst I was still awaiting my refund. I was told that this would not be possible and that there were no such codes to provide. My alternative option was to place another order, pay next day delivery and request a refund for my delivery cost (which I went ahead with). I was advised that I would receive an update within 2 days re my delivery cost refund, and once again, I've heard nothing further re this!! I was also told that should no one be in touch, for me to chase it up (yet again) and quote the ref 44245684. I'm beyond disappointed with Asos on this occasion and responsibilityits put on its customer to continue chasing a matter up which is simply out of my hands.

Their continued partnership with Evri shows an utter disrespect for their customers and constant dodging questions and repeated lies just to get you off their chat service with supposed ""customer service"" advisors is laughable. Because I refused to accept being told I wad to wait again for a next day delivery that was now over 10 days late they decided to block my account to make it difficult for me to contact them whilst holding ??400 of my money. The only reason I got a refund eventually is because I took matters into my own hands after they had repeatedly ended chats when asked difficult questions and emailed their CEO (got from a quick google search). Funnily the refund they were not able to process was confirmed 10 minutes later.

Response from customer services email 'This is why we send you an expected delivery date and not a guaranteed delivery date.' presumably it is unreasonable for customers to actually expect their parcel to arrive. Patronising and condescending also no way of contacting delivery form without going through ASOS and their response (quoted again from customer services) 'As they are a third party company, we have no control over what details they have on their website or how customers can get in touch with them' but also state 'If you get in touch after your estimated delivery date advising your parcel has not arrived, our process is to chase this up with the carrier to find out a new delivery date or if your parcel is lost' so completely contradict themselves.

I?€?ve heard lots of bad things but because my sister got me a gift voucher for my birthday, I decided to give it a try. Worst mistake on my part. On my first order, I got a few items which were okay (because they were bigger brands) but a few items were so unexpectedly bad that I was irritated. I ordered a pair of jeans from the same brand and in the same size as the other jeans I own and wear everyday, yet they arrived in a size that was ABSOLUTELY NOT CORRECT despite the tag itself being right. With moving around a lot I wasn?€?t able to return the items in time so I lost money and time waiting on the package. My boyfriend ordered a few weeks later and of course the same thing happened, his items (despite being the EXACT SAME BRAND AND SIZE AS HE ALWAYS WEARS) were small and short. Again due to moving he has been unable to return and while he will attempt to return it soon, it has been such an inconvenience for us. Never ordering from them again. In addition, the customer service is absolutely horrible and essentially USELESS. I highly recommend getting your brands from the stores themselves or other online shops.

I waited a week before lodging a complaint.Now, ASOS have shut down their twitter account and customer complaints number, so the only way to complain was via their semi-automated chat function.

Me telling them the tracker had been stuck on ?€?out for delivery?€? for a fortnight fell on deaf ears. I told them I had already been promised a refund - twice.

After i didnt know i had the money, spended it, etc and now im left without jacket, refund or any compensation because of their mistake.So in general they didnt even tell me at the time i was refunded, i never knew about it until 2 days ago (after almost 1 year) and know they dont send the jacket back, dont refund me nor give me any compensation after all the trouble they caused me other than a way for them to gain more money from me (20% discount) because obviously after all this trouble i wont ever be buying from them.Remember what happened to me can happen to any of you...",PT,Rated 1 out of 5 stars
Hasan Ahmed,"December 13, 2022",ITS THE WORST,"ITS THE WORST! I ordered few my items on the 13th of November 2022 which I also paid the next day delivery. The item didn't even come the next day and I am still waiting for my items. I ordered the item to wear them for a special occasion because the items didn't come I had to buy from somewhere else last minute. So disappointed they didn't even reach out to me to reassure me about my order. They used EVRI as a courier and you can't even speak to them because you have to have an account with them. This was the worst experience never ever again going to order from them. Stay away from ASOS don't believe what everyone says how good they are. Funny thing it was my very first order. I had to reach out to customer service through their live chat portal to ask them where my item was, the customer service advisor gave me a grey answer lol, I had to ask a refund for the next day delivery service I paid for. If they have delivery an issue they need to put a live update on their website and not allow people to do a next day delivery. So customers can go elsewhere where they will know definitely they will get their item. I'm frustrated and angry with this experience with ASOS.",GB,Rated 1 out of 5 stars

ASOS customer care then offered a discount that still would not  match the original price, until they finally did. A week later, I receive a discount code - but less than agreed upon and still no info about a corrected refund. Now it will apparently be fixed but without any ETA.

As I was taking them off I noticed there was a dirty tissue in the pocket!! So gross!

Over the 10 or so orders I made over the past year, only 2 were delivered next day. Not the end of the world, but you certainly don't get what they are advertising. What's worse than that is when one of their delivery partners (usually Evri) lose your parcel. You have to wait for 2 days after the planned delivery date, then another 5 days for an investigation and then however long asos decide to take to update you. Most of the time they won't and you will have to chase, all the while not being eligible for a refund or even replacements until the very last minute. Customer Services are very stiff. You'll usually get ""I totally understand, but we can't help"". You'll also be constantly bombarded with emails about new discounts and ""order now for delivery before Christmas!""

It is handy being able to purchase so many brands in one place, but I really wouldn't recommend ASOS. If you have to use them I definitely wouldn't bother with premier membership.

I do not have the funds to do this until the refund is processed and now just have to hope the item doesn't sell out or go up in price while i wait for the money to be returned. I feel the company not offering a replacement for an item they have sent damaged is them not taking any responsibility for the products they stock and send out, and i am unsure if i will re-order with them as i worry if they don't care about the quality of items they send out if the shoes i send back will just be sent out again in the hope the next person wont mind or wont want to go through the return process",GB,Rated 3 out of 5 stars

Decided this year to make another purchase during Black Friday sales. Forgot my account was blocked so contacted the support. They told me my case will be escalated to tech team, that was in November. I've contacted them twice after that, I was told tech team is looking into it. Today however, customer care told me tech team didn't find anything, but no one told me?? I can very easily request a password reset, so there is an account (account still blocked). How customer support cannot find it, blowns my mind. Then they adviced me to create another account, which I have already done when my first account was blocked. Now can't even use that as reset password emails don't get sent. I don't understand. I've done nothing suspicious but order some socks, but it seems Asos doesn't like customers or their money.

I used live chat to try to resolve the issue. What a wast of time. They asked me to take a screenshot of the Black Friday code, which was no longer showing on their website. I took a screenshot of my original order plus the advert showing the code for Black Friday. This was not good enough so I asked to speak to a supervisor but was told one was not available and they would tell me the same thing.

They HAVE to launch another investigation with Evri before refund can be issued. PLEASE DO NOT ORDER. They have closed down call centre and are ignoring and deleting comments on social media. They even delete their twitter accounts! The only way to contact is via chat now which has a big queue throughout the day so you have to wait till after midnight to get through. Asos is in the process of closing down/ going into administration with all of our money. The reason why their customer service is not doing anything because they have been told by higher managers, directors and CEO not to! They are purposely not sending out replacements and not issuing refunds because this is their last ditch attempt to keep hold of SOME money! There is no phone number. Only number is for head office. The last chat agent even admitted they don?€?t have a legal department anymore!! This is such a lie! Can you really imagine a multi national company without a massive legal department. PLEASE contact your banks and start chargeback process BEFORE Asos closes. I also had nearly ??250 in vouchers and will never get it back!

I was home and I also have a camera in front of the house - not delivery attempt was made.

It is the retailer's responsibility to take care of this kind of situation. I called Asos today. Instead of taking me seriously right after the call they decided to change the status of the order in the own website to delivered.

After searching for the specific item, I wanted in the usual places I came across the item in stock on Asos.com, and thought this was superb. Unsurprisingly the process of placing an order and the company taking my money was extremely easy. Order placed for next day delivery. all sorted. or so I thought.I received confirmation e-mails of the order and thought nothing more of it. The next day came and went. No Delivery. I left it a few days and over the following weekend thinking surely 4 working days would be fine. No delivery. I tried to track the order at this time. No change of status on the order and so I thought I would contact them to see where my order was. As with a lot of companies these days the ability to actually speak to a human is like finding a needle in a haystack. The only option was an online chat. Tried twice and kept getting kicked out, and eventually got through to chat with someone, only to be told there is a delay and I had to wait another 3 working days before I could contact them again. Great next day service!!They even had the cheek to send me a questionnaire e-mail 2 days after the order was placed saying now you have received your order, please tell us how we did. An absolute joke!!So, 3 days came and went, no delivery! I again go through the arduous process of the automated chat bot to finally get to chat to a person, only to be told that there is a delay and I have to allow another 3 working days. As you can imagine this did not go down well with me and I politely requested the order be cancelled as it was now over a week and a half since I ordered, and I had no idea if my item would ever arrive.I was promptly told that they could only advise I wait the 3 days and closed the chat without an opportunity to reply.This only enraged me further. I opened another chat and had a conversation with someone far more eloquent who took the time to explain why they were unable to cancel the order at this point and kindly offered to refund my next day delivery fee. I am still awaiting to see if the item will ever arrive, but I have to say blaming the courier for delays when the item has not left the warehouse and the follow up customer service has been shocking, apart from the last person I did a live chat with.I will never order from them again and I would tell anyone the same.",GB,Rated 1 out of 5 stars

I received final 'rejection' but still with no proof of photos or clear reason as to why. It's just ""unsuitable for return"". Somewhere in the customer service chat 2 weeks ago, their customer service said the jacket ""was too shiny"", something I said straight away when I returned the jacket due to it looking different from the picture (clearly stated by me). It looks like Asos sent me a wrong product (there's exactly the same jacket in a more shiny version), I returned it and I can't get my money back due to Asos' mistake. They have also failed to return the jacket within 7 working days of the return rejection so right I have no jacket and no money. I have stated multiple times to their customer service that their warehouse made an initial mistake and sent a wrong jacket. I am not a person to photograph every second of my life so I have no pictures of me trying on a jacket, that at first I didn't realise was a wrong product. I just thought they didn't photograph it well so returned it. However, Asos also doesn't have any photos to prove to me of what they've sent and received but I am the one taking consequences and losing both, jacket and money. Needles to say I will never ever order from them again. This horrible experience cost me a lot of money and time.",GB,Rated 1 out of 5 stars

Lynne,"December 05, 2022",Very disappointed with your company,"Dear upper management,After spending over an hour on an online chat this morning with one of your customer service representatives, I am extremely disappointed with your company.  I recently placed my first order with your company and loved everything that I received.  I wanted to exchange 1 of my sweaters for a different size.  I understand the companies policy for not offering exchanges.  So what I was going to do is send back the sweater for a refund and repurchase the same sweater in a different size. As I used a coupon code on my original order, ( which was a total of $10.00) I wanted to repurchase the sweater and asked for a new coupon code as I wanted the same cost as on my original order. I was on a chat for over an hour to be offered 10% which is $5.00 off and then 15% off my next order which is a total of $7.50 ( again not $10.00) so for a difference of $2.50 you have now lost a new customer. Really is this how you attempt to fix an issue on an order with a new customer.  I was not asking for anything other than the cost that I paid on my original order. ( most companies offer exchanges) maybe you should look into that.  So let me ask you a question?  For a total of $10.00 it was worth you losing a customer?  You went from offering a 10% to 15% discount but you wouldn?€?t give me 20% which would have been the full $10.00.  I think that is absolutely the most ridiculous thing that I have ever heard, especially around the holidays when I will probably receive another coupon so  I can spend more money with your company.  Does this make any sense to you?  God awful experience with your company and all over  the $10.00 That was mine in the first place. If you are comfortable with the decision that you made and you feel good about it, then good riddance to your company.  I hope you feel proud.Lynne Schwartz",US,Rated 1 out of 5 stars

Steven Lynch,"December 02, 2022","Next day delivery, is NOT next day","Using the Premier Delivery service, I placed an order to be received the next day. I received notification that it was on its way. Later, upon checking to see where it was, it stated that it had been delayed. I contacted ASOS as I was leaving the country the following day, hence needing the delivery on the day specified. I was advised that given the urgency, they would continue to attempt delivery that day up until 10pm. There was no delivery. I contacted ASOS again the following day to find out what was happening, and to request a refund for the Premier Delivery - it is not what it is sold as, and to advise that they should cancel delivery as it would not be possible to take delivery now that I was going to be out of the country.The individual's on live chat are generally very helpful, but they have one hand tied behind their back whilst ASOS continues to use the incompetent EVRi. However, there are issues with the live chat service too; at times the responses are incredibly slow. I spent the best part of 1.5 hours on live chat. I don't have time to sit waiting for replies and in instances where they reply and you don't reply within 1 minute they cut you off. Yet I was waiting 5-10 minutes for replies. The only solution, to a problem that was not created by me, was that I should arrange for someone else to take delivery of the parcel whilst I was out of the country as it could not be guaranteed that EVRi would agree to not deliver it (despite the fact it was already two days without even trying to deliver) why I was being made to provide the solution here, I do not know.I was advised that the delay was due to 'road incidents'. I am not sure what this means but I assume it is fictional. There was no road incidents in or near my location that day and certainly none that lasted 3 days. What turned out to be largely the typically awful service from EVRi, escalated to being made worse by how exceptionally unhelpful and inflexible ASOS are. It became apparent across the conversations with 4 separate agents on live chat that the ASOS priority is not it's customers. I can't believe ASOS' cash flow is so bad that they need to take and keep my ??100 whilst not delivering my goods, but if they continue with this level of service, maybe their cashflow is, or will be a problem.I will continue to fight for the refund of my Premier Delivery that was miss-sold to me. It is not relevant that I have previously used it - those orders would have been entitled to free next day delivery anyway. Meantime, if you're thinking about ordering with ASOS, and need it the next day, think twice. And if you're thinking about paying for premier, you'd be better staying clear until they can find a competent delivery partner.",GB,Rated 1 out of 5 stars

Since the second time they were not on sale, I had to pay an additional 8.5 euros, but unfortunately the same thing happened again, the glue came off, just in a different place, so obviously I wanted to return them, expecting the gift voucher and the 8.5 euro refund. In the meantime, I closed my bank account that was used to place both orders, but updated this information on my account way before the second refund was initiated, and when talking to the customer service team, I very clearly asked if they can make sure the refund was made on the card that is now active. This is where it gets interesting...After exchanging more than 10 emails, each time with a different person, it became clear to me that either no one is trained properly and doesn't know how to check if the refund was made, on which card, if it was rejected or not, or they are just not willing to return 8.5 euros to a customer, which I really don't want to believe in because it is laughable. Moreover, one person stated the refund was made to the active card (I checked with the bank 3 times, no trace of the transaction), and then someone else tells me it has actually been made to the no longer active one, then asking me TWICE to confirm if it is really inactive, even though I have made this clear from the very beginning. This leads me to believe that: 1) they are either incompetent (very likely), 2) trying to delay the process until I get tired and give up (not going to happen), 3) or don't actually know how to make a refund (highly unlikely).Obviously, the amount of money is not at issue here, but what is is the way they approached the problem, their incompetence/unwillingness to actually help beyond the usual 'I'm keen on resolving this for you', 'I'd love to help', etc etc, that I am definitely going to avoid ever shopping here again (even though I made a purchase during the Black Friday sale, only to use the voucher) after 10+ years. It is really a huge shame that Asos allowed themselves to become this ignorant to their customers, since I know for a fact that this wasn't the case in the past.",FR,Rated 1 out of 5 stars

Stephanie Palmer,"December 02, 2022",Shocking service - lost/stolen item,"I placed a ??200 order a week ago during the Black Friday sales. Immediately I saw there was a delivery issue with Evri, as the ASOS status changed from ?€?item is sent?€? to ?€?item being returned to ASOS?€?. I went through to customer care and was told to wait and see if it turns up. The status changed back to ?€?dispatched?€? and I received a tracking number. On the day of delivery the item was delayed, then marked as delivered at 9pm, 4 hours after the delivery window, which seemed fishy. I went to the parcel shop and my parcel had not arrived. I went back again three more times over the next few days, the parcel wasn?€?t there. I spoke to ASOS customer care again and was told they were launching a query with evri and to wait two business days. It was clear at the point the parcel had been lost/stolen as so many people have experienced with Evri, however ASOS wouldn?€?t issue a replacement, even though it was clear the item was NEVER making its way to me. Today my two days was up so I contacted customer care (for the 6th time) and was told the items would be resent to me. At no point was I told these items were not in stock - I looked online and they?€?ve been in stock all day. However, the two most heavily discounted items have been refunded to me, rather than the order being honoured as they are ?€?no longer available?€? - like many other customers in recent reviews, it?€?s clear that ASOS simply don?€?t want to honour those discounts so have chosen to refund. I?€?ve shopped with ASOS for 10+ years and I?€?m a regular customer but going forward I won?€?t be placing any orders. Next time I?€?ll try amazon. I?€?ve wasted hours going back and forth on message and not being able to actually TALK to a human. I don?€?t know how they?€?re operating with such a flawed system.",GB,Rated 1 out of 5 stars

I think that to keep customers happy you should issue a refund or replace/send the item as the delivery service (evri) has lost the parcel (as they have done in the past many times). I have bought many items after buying this item and they have come next day, I don't want to keep buying the same thing just because of asos' lazy policies and if I want a refund then I will have to wait 1+weeks for the money to come back and not a lot of people have hundreds lying around because ASOS can't be bothered to refund immediately.",GB,Rated 1 out of 5 stars

Sarah Barry,"November 28, 2022",The worst customer service I've ever experienced,"Today is my 11th anniversary with ASOS and it will definitely be my last. A week ago I had a parcel stolen by their Evri delivery driver. I have him very clearly on my Ring cam and my CCTV - there's no question at all. Trying to explain this to ASOS customer services is an exercise in futility. I've spent literally hours this week trying to get this sorted. I won't bite you with the details or the ridiculous questions they've been asking, but suffice to say, they were totally uninterested in anything about the theft. Four days later I got them to agree to resend the items but then got an email saying half the order was out of stock. The items were in stock before and after my chat and still are.  Like others here, I bought these things in the sale and they are now double the price so clearly they don't want to send them out again I contacted them again and spent over an hour trying to explain why they needed to resend these items rather than get me to order them at twice the price.  I got offered the usual 15% discount - nope - eventually after a lengthy (20 mins plus) run of silence he said they would send me a 50% off code to reorder. I got him to repeat this several times. Of course the code never materialized. Because it bears repeating, their courier stole my parcel on multiple cameras and they weren't interested. They've spent a week fobbing me off rather than simply resending the stolen items. This isn't the first time I've had issues with ASOS - far from it. I am done with ASOS. I am returning everything I've bought this past month and never using them again.",GB,Rated 1 out of 5 stars

Emy,"December 01, 2022",Gutted with the customer service :(,"Really disappointed with my customer service experience today. I ordered a pair of trainers last week I had my eye on for ages. I saw they were in the sale and asos was also running a discount code for a further reduction so I ordered them. They were quite expensive and although I love the look of them, it was hard to justify spending that much so I was so pleased to see them in the sale. They were supposed to be delivered on Saturday but the courier updated to say it was unable to deliver due to bad weather. I kept an eye on the tracking since but no update. I used the chat feature with asos and asked them to look into it. They advised they would raise an investigation with the courier and I needed to leave it two working days. I left it two days and messaged today. The lady I spoke with first on chat (won?€?t use names as I don?€?t agree with that) was really helpful and advised that there was no update and she would happily resend. I was really happy as I was quite worried I was going to have to wait ages for help. I praised the cs agent and asked where would be a good place to leave a review and she advise there would be a feedback email and to leave one on here. I checked my email after and I had a refund notification. We had agreed the item would be resent. I went back on chat and the agent I spoke with then confirmed a mistake had been made and a refund had been issued not replacement. I asked if I replaced the order, would asos honour the price I paid to which the agent replied he would give me a 10% off code. I explained that wasn?€?t the discount on the order before and it was a considerable amount more. The agent began to the barter with me basically coming back with 15%. He had access to my orders and could see how much I had paid. I explained that I dont think it?€?s fair for me to pay more for the same item, especially when the issue wasn?€?t my fault and I have asked to order again on good faith. He kept coming back saying sorry that?€?s all he could do. He then eventually came back with a 20% off code to which I settled on because I do really want the shoes and all together had spent over an hour on chat. I have still paid more for the re -order. Is this the way asos does things now? It comes across as greedy. I used to hold asos in quite high regard but my trust in the ethics/culture has really been tarnished now. I usually have asos as my default place to shop and never usually go else where but I think this experience has really made me think twice. Such a shame asos.

They use EVRi delivery company, which is an awful establishment (calling them a company would offend real companies out there). ASOS in collaboration with EVRi managed to loss 4 of my parcels. I paid for the next day delivery on all of these 4 occasions. EVRi does not have a customer service, it is impossible to speak to a human being who can provide adequate assistance. ASOS blames everything on EVRi and avoids responsibility. ASOS's solution to the problem is that they promise a refund, but they can issue a refund only after the ""lost"" parcel have been delivered back to them. Thus, I never got any refund for those lost items. I could give their customer service -1000 stars if I could.",GB,Rated 1 out of 5 stars

ASOS representative #1 then assured me that the parcel will be delivered to the post office in a week's time (so standard delivery) and to contact ASOS again if it does not come by that time so that I can be issued with a refund/replacement. As the parcel has not arrived AND for some reason is now being sent back to ASOS, I have contacted ASOS once again, who will not process my return/replacement until the next day. What is most infuriating and appalling about this is the inconsistencies with the customer service:1) The #1 representative assured me that the parcel would still be able to be delivered to the original address by a certain date and a refund/replacement be issued if it fails to do so2) The #2 representative says that this is a delivery service issue and will not issue a refund/replacement until the next dayI am lost as to why #1 was able to reassure and say the parcel will still be delivered whereas #2 blames it on the delivery service.I am also quite appalled at the attitude of the #2 representative, who rather than answering the questions I was asking specifically, was providing a generic response previously stated. They then said that ""I am repeating the same sentences continuously"" despite the fact that it was because they were misreading my questions.

Terrible for the environment, as much of it might just go in the bin or contributes to carbon during transport.?€? Exchanges have been removed ?€? this is so annoying considering if you buy something with a code e.g. Black Friday and then have to return it because the sizing is not accurate at all, then have to pay full price again. I'm refunding my order without rebuying it because of this. Fair enough if I made a mistake on sizing, but it's ridiculously too big and ASOS hasn't state it is oversize, then why would I buy a smaller size.?€? Customer Service is rude and unhelpful. They speak like a 13-year-old sibling who is going through the cheeky, nonchalant phase of puberty. Doesn't cost extra time to be polite or pretend to help.

Any sane person could see these don't belong together and this should have not passed any sort of inspection. Now as the customer I have to assume all the burden in this. Taking the time to file the complaint and process the return, repackaging the item for return, making a trip to the UPS store, and of course not having the item I needed and expected to have. The representative only had the means to process a refund because the item I ordered is apparently no longer available in inventory. All they could say was to check back and reorder if the item became available, and offered me a 15% discount code after I complained. Yet I purchased the item during a big sale when there was a 39% discount so even if it somehow becomes available again I would be paying more for it the second time.I appreciate the representative for trying to help, but overall I am furious about this ridiculous situation and the burdensome resolution that I had to accept.",US,Rated 2 out of 5 stars

Contacted ASOS, they stated parcel was too big for a locker, asked for it to be resent, no can't do that, can only issue a refund for me to reorder. My order was during the sales so all items are out of stock or back at normal price.The only way to make contact is via a chat, you can't make a formal complaint, probably a good thing for them looking at the reviews on this website, they would be mega busy! Can't see myself using them again unless I have to.. then again that's a risk in it's self. This is not the first time I've had issues but I put it down to a one off, but clearly I was wrong.

The pick up spot refused. Sent back to ASOS. I repeat - I?€?ve been in all day. Then spoke to ASOS. AWFUL customer service rep. Bad English. Bad communication. Unclear. Then rude about me not understanding their haphazard, badly written messages. I have screen shots I can send you if you care at all about your customers. Apparently my package can?€?t be resent to me. Why is this? I pay for next day delivery too. Was told I have to reorder the items. One of them is already out of stock.

anonymous,"November 26, 2022",DONT ORDER FROM THIS COMPANY,"If I could put zero stars, I would. Wish I had of read more reviews before ordering. IF YOU LIVE IN CANADA, DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS COMPANY. This is the worst experience I?€?ve ever had ordering clothing online. They say free shipping on their website over a certain amount, THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS FREE SHIPPING WITH THIS COMPANY. I ordered 5 items of clothing that came to $250 CAD. When I went to post office to pick up my clothes, there was a $94 Collect on Delivery Fee added to it. I had to pay $94 to obtain my $250 valued clothes. Totally absurd. Never have I ever paid that amount, and I?€?ve ordered a lot more in clothing from overseas. These came from the USA warehouse. ASOS uses a company called Landmark Global to act as an agent for YOU, the customer in Canada. Landmark Global collects the packages from USA, pays the customs fee/duty and taxes, then charges you the collect on deliver fee that goes back to them. Yet you don?€?t get to see what the taxes or duty cost or any other cost was that added up to the collect on delivery fee amount! For all you know, you?€?re being scammed out of more money than was actually needed to be paid at the border. There is no way to find out what was actually paid at the border. Why ASOS doesn?€?t just ship directly to the customer, instead of using Landmark Global as the middle man is beyond me!! It makes doing returns impossible too. Their clothing isn?€?t even that great of quality. It?€?s not worth what I paid, even without the added collect on delivery fee. One pair of pants was too small that I had to return, and was required to pay $22.40 CAD for a return label off their website to do so. Yet the return label off ASOS website has the item shipping to Landmark Global and not the ASOS warehouse in Georgia where the clothes came from. Landmark Global deals with many companies, and there is no way for them to know to ship this item back to ASOS warehouse, if they even do that. I?€?m sure my return package is now lost and i?€?ll never get a refund!! It?€?s already been two weeks since I shipped it back. ASOS prints faulty return labels!! It?€?s their fault! Yet i?€?m sure I?€?ll be the one paying the price by not getting a refund!! Overall, I paid $369.40 CAD for 5 crappy ASOS clothing items, one which is now lost in the mail. What a complete joke. I feel like a naive sucker who was taken advantage of. Customer service is completely useless and won?€?t even respond for weeks at a time or actually do what they say they will.

This is my first time ordering from ASOS and I likely will not order from them again. This delay for receiving a cancellation confirmation email makes me feel uneasy. The chat rep said the cancelled order might ship and then I have to return it to get my refund. This is a totally unnecessary waste of everyones' time and resources, mine and Asos's.

I then messaged another three agents until 14.50 pm!! No surprise they did not help.

That was if they did bother to reply because i constantly had to remind them i was in a chat with them. Basically they just ignore you for ages but if you don't respond to them within 1 minute they end the chat.I asked the same thing for over 2hrs. Why wasn't my parcel arriving next day and that if ASOS could not provide a service i had paid for then they need to refund my premier delivery cost.Finally i was told that due to large volumes of orders next day delivery is unavailable!! I can't have my money back as i've already paid it. Just one of the many stupid comments made by the agents. He proceeded to send me a link to trust pilot and said complain here and he would like to offer me 15% discount on my next order.NOOOOO. I would actually like to speak to a senior member of staff on the telephone because clearly all the ASOS agents are way below average intelligence and can't speak, understand or write the english language.

Kim Bodle,"November 25, 2022",COMPLETELY AND UTTERLY DISGUSTED WITH?€?,"COMPLETELY AND UTTERLY DISGUSTED WITH THE APPALLING CUSTOMER SERVICE. I placed an order for next day delivery on Wednesday of last week, when I check Evri tracking and I discover that there is an issue and that the parcel is not out for delivery. I contact ASOS and speak with a member of the ?€??€?customer care?€??€? team to request that they cancel the order as it will arrive too late for the intended purpose of it now and to issue a refund. I am told I have to wait for the ?€?timeframe?€? of 24 hours to expire before they will do anything at all even though tracking made it very clear I would not be receiving my parcel that day as scheduled and paid for. I contacted them again the following Monday (parcel now 5 days late and still nowhere to be seen) to inform the ?€??€?customer care?€??€? team that I have still not received my parcel and that I would like for the order to be canceled and a refund issued. After much regurgitated piffle about internal policies and autogenerated phrases to convey empathy I was informed that they would not issue my refund as I need to wait 48hrs for ASOS to complete and internal investigation with Evri. I am assured that my refund will be issued after the 48hrs passes. Begrudgingly I concede to wait. 48hrs pass and the following morning I receive an email telling me that I need to wait a further 48hrs for the investigation to be completed. I get back on to the ?€??€?customer care?€??€? team to advise that I have already waited 48hrs and that I would like my refund now as I was assured well over 48hrs ago. More wildly frustrating regurgitated piffle and autogenerated empathy for my situation endues and then I?€?m told it takes 48hrs for the investigation to be raised and another 48hrs for the investigation to be conducted(?!). Throughout this ordeal I have spoken to 5 ?€??€?customer care?€??€? assistants but received no assistance whatsoever. I had the chat ended rudely and abruptly on me twice, I had the insinuation made that I may have actually received the parcel and they need to confirm that I hadn?€?t before issuing the refund to me(?!) I shared my offense at this and the fact that I have both a Ring Doorbell and a cctv system in place to assure them I have not! I was told after having to persist for the answer that the complaints link on the website doesn?€?t work and that ASOS has no formal complaints procedure whatsoever. My parcel is now 8 days late without any indication of its whereabouts and my refund is still being witheld.

I can always return my current items and order new one on your website with the new discount code. but I feel that will be wasting ASOS time as well as not so green with moving things back and forth.Unfortunately the only was to get the cheaper price was to return the goods and reorder according to company policy..Which I really think is not so Green option. I might even feel guilty to send the products back and reorder and then trashing the environment.So the outcome was not what I expected.

Claire,"November 24, 2022",Appalling,"I went onto webchat to report that I received a 500ml dermalogica cleanser with a broken hygiene seal.

I wasn?€?t happy with this as I am a nurse and I don?€?t have time to run around returning items to stores, especially when it?€?s the company?€?s fault. The company should put that expense on themselves and either send someone out to collect it or offer another solution. When I explained this to the agent he ended the chat, meaning I had to start all over again with a new agent and explain everything all over again. He explained the same thing but also assured me that a manager would get back to me as I would like to escalate my complaint not only about the cleanser but also about the agent that cut me off. This has been a horrendous experience with asos and for a huge company like asos I would have expected a more customer focussed solution, but yet I am the only one being in inconvenienced by spending my own time and money running around returning an item they sent to me with a broken hygiene seal, and apparently the only way to make a complaint is to do it over webchat where the advisor will ?€?document it?€? for me. Really really poor. This is the second poor experience I?€?ve had with asos and I wanted to give them another try because maybe the last time was a one off but after this never ever again.

Etta,"November 23, 2022",Leather items in Non-leather section,"Leather items in Non-leather section. I purchased some shoes that were listed in the Non-leather section of this store. The material description also did not list leather or suede-leather. Upon receiving the shoes it was obvious that it was leather. I contacted the company support chat and they told me it was my fault because it was clear from the image of the shoes that it did in fact contain leather. This was very disrespectful and upsetting as it was not helpful at all and did not address the issue. Just because something 'looks' like leather, doesn't mean it contains leather. If the shoes are in the 'non-leather' section and the material description don't list leather, then anyone will assume it is Faux-leather which obviously looks like leather, too. I am shocked that they told me it was my fault because of an IMAGE of the item, it is obviously their fault because they are listing LEATHER items in the Non-Leather section! It is misleading and distressing for customers who do not want to wear leather fashion. And also the fact that the online 'looking' like leather is subjective, to me the suede-leather looked like a rough synthetic overlay, and it's in the non-leather section so of course I didn't assume it was leather. I cannot believe I was told it was my fault.For any ASOS employees the shoes specifically are 'adidas Originals ZX22 Boost trainers in black' and your website description of materials read: 'Textile upperSole: 100% Rubber, Upper: 100% Other fibres.'. and also this item is listed in the 'NON-LEATHER' section that your store has implemented to make it easier for people to avoid purchasing leather if they want to. And just because an image of shoes 'looks like leather' doesn't mean it's your customers fault for purchasing it if they wish to avoid leather, many non-leather shoes aim to appear and feel like leather, it's called faux-leather and faux-suede, so your employee telling me it's my fault based upon that was awful.",AU,Rated 1 out of 5 stars

Then claiming he processed a refund even though I could clearly tell it's not true. Luckily, I kept insisting on checking into the return again because I knew it wasn't processed. The issue got sorted after spending 2h on the chat but that was only thanks to the fact that the conversation got transferred to someone else.

Ashley Glanc,"November 21, 2022",Don't order to Canada ... you will pay heavily,"I ordered from ASOS to Canada. My order totalled just over $677. When I went to pick up my parcel, my charges were over $220. I asked the Canada Post employee why the charges were so high, when import duties in to Canada were only supposed to be 15%. She explained to me that ASOS uses a fulfillment provider called Landmark Global, that pays on behalf of customer orders. They then charge you COD to release the package at the post office. The don't offer you your import duty breakdown that is normally attached to your package, but provide you with one lump sum to pay in order to get your parcel. I have contacted both ASOS and Landmark. ASOS just said it's not their fault, however, it is their choice in service providers. There should be a disclosure that they are using Landmark as a 2nd party fulfilment provider, and that you will be paying additional fees on top of regular customs and duties. Super dishonest. Thankfully the CP employee suggested that if I didn't want to pay the INSANE charge, that I just refuse the parcel, which I am going to do. So sad that ASOS threw up their hands and took no responsibility for this. I also tried to save my chat with ASOS, and the save function did not work, so now I have no copy of what transpired in my nearly 45 minute online chat with their customer service rep Sambesh.

Rachel,"November 20, 2022",Poor Service,i am really disappointed with the service I have received. I ordered 7 hooded Santa dresses and when they arrived this week 4 out of 7 were the wrong dress.

I returned them and wrote all this on the return notes and ordered them again. The second new package arrived and AGAIN  had the 4 incorrect dresses with the hooded label on them.

I did not receive the order nor did the Evri tracking ever say that it was collected from ASOS.I contacted Asos via chat on Wednesday to let them know that it had not been delivered and that there was an issue with the tracking. I was asked to wait until Thursday to see if it would be delivered and if not then to get back in contact and that I would be helped with a refund or replacement. I got back in contact on Thursday 17th November as requested by the colleague. The customer service agent told me firstly that there maybe a glitch in the system, that the order had not be collected from the warehouse due to not passing quality control and that I need to wait again. I was provided conflicting information being promised my order would be delivered, but if not to contact customer services yet again. I explained that my other orders had been delivered without any issues for that day so I knew I wouldn't expect another delivery that day. It was just constantly going back and forth. It became very frustrating. The advisor offered me a 15% discount instead of explaining what exactly was going on with the order. It has taken me 4 individual times contacting Asos to get my refund, with one chat being nearly an hour. As someone who is disabled and rarely shops on the highstreet, I rely on asos orders. I have never had a single issue with service since becoming a customer and I usually have praise for the service. I love shopping with asos and the chat function is easy to use and I get through to someone very quickly. But I'm now concerned that if I have a future issue with an order I will be given incorrect information or told to wait over and over again despite me explaining in detail that there is a problem with the order. I understand there are time frames and rules, but it should not take me 4 attempts at contact to receive coherent advice, clarity on what is happening with an order and support from customer service. The last two times I made contact I did receive a better service both from Nisha and Harpreet who explained the issue and were polite. I did appreciate this. I've now received my refund (thank you Harpreet) but this experience has lefted me very disappointed. As someone who shops regularly I feel very let down by the whole experience.

I was supposed to receive my order on November 16th. I didn?€?t receive it on the 16th or the seventeenth. So that?€?s when I contacted asos customer service. I asked for a refund for my expedited shipping and Abigail was able to refund my shipping costs due to the item being delayed multiple times. I would have liked to cancel the whole order since it had been delayed so significantly, but I was told that the cancellation window had already passed. Even though I didn?€?t get my issue entirely resolved to my satisfaction, the woman who I talked to was apologetic, patient, and attempted to rectify the issue in a kind manner. I would also like to add that getting to a real customer support person and not an automated program was frustrating. It shouldn?€?t be so difficult to get through to a customer service representative. Finally, I was told that my item should arrive no later than the 24th of November! What? I was supposed the get it on the 16th.

As frustrating as it was, I understand that these things happen, so I went onto the website, followed the guidance and requested a refund. I then went to re order the same item again, however there was a price difference, so I had to use their Chat line system. Initially I struggled with even getting onto the chat feature, then I got connected to Anmol. They commenced the chat with ?€?Hi l am sorry about the wrong item.?€? So I waited a bit longer as I was expecting a question about the order, however the next message I received was stating they were going to end the chat as they hadn?€?t heard from me, so I replied that they hadn?€?t asked a question? And they then ended the chat immediately! Already fairly annoyed at this point, I went back onto the chat feature to try and get the original issue resolved and to complain about Anmol. I spoke to Sofia who, after 40 minutes eventually reordered my order for me, but I never received confirmation of this, so who knows if I ever receive it. I then tried to complain and was met with ?€?sorry to hear that, it won?€?t happen again?€?. How is that resolving a complaint? I tried to say I wasn?€?t happy with that response, and she continued so say the same thing. I asked for a manager to contact me, and then Sofia pretended to be her manager in the chat.

I'll keep my hands tied up to this?€? which is quite a unique thing for anyone to say? 2 hours of trying to get the issue resolved, I tried to speak to someone else through the chat and got the same response, so I gave up, very deflated and my night ruined, all because they sent the wrong item.

I was told i could only return it and purchase another dress. Typically other businesses will provide a partial refund for these situations. I was offered a promo code to use in the future, but was still asked to send back the dress. This made no sense due to the fact i would be out of money from the initial purchase. the fault of the wrong size was ASOS, so it was ASOS responsibility to make it right. Asked to speak with the manager and was ignored.  In the end i was given a promo for future use, but the amount of pleading I had to do was insane.

The second time, I was told that the parcel was marked as delivered so they would have to raise it with Evri and I should chase them again after 2 days. I did, and they said they are still waiting to hear from Evri, meanwhile I'm out of pocket and the parcel is clearly lost but I can't get my money back. Third time the parcel never showed as shipped and never arrived and they just keep telling me to wait for it to ship, when I paid for next day delivery! I still have not had any acknowledgement that the last 2 parcels are missing or had my money back, and keep being told to wait X number of days and chase them again. This system is insane and insulting to loyal customers.In my most recent live chat I asked for someone to tell me how to contact the complaints department and was told I would get a refund at some point.

When something happens by their mistake they do not provide a link for a feedback. Keep that in mind. I refused my package and a carrier company sent it back to Asos. I have a confirmation email from a carrier company saying that the package was delivered to Asos. Asos refunded me only for 20% of the items from the package, claiming that the rest was missing. Asos refused to pay a refund and blocked my account. Now I?€?m waiting 5 days already to receive an official email from Asos with all the details (reason of refusing, case number, order number, amount they refused to refund, tracking numbers etc).

Laura,"November 03, 2022",Next day delivery non existant,"I have paid for premium delivery and the last two occasions my deliveries have been days late. When talking to the chat they said the team would email me to support me and I never received any emails. Responses on the chat are just that the delivery should arrive in two more days but if not to get in contact again. However why pay for premium next day delivery if you don?€?t stick to this? It seems since you are with evri next day delivery is non existent, there is never any apologies or refunds or anything to apologise for the delays. I have been with asos for years and it has put me off ordering with you again. I ordered a dress 3 days before my baby shower expecting next day delivery as that?€?s what I paid for and it arrived afterwards so I didn?€?t have the outfit I wanted for that day. There is no way of complaining which is also frustrating for your customers, it seems you do not want to help customers who need it, the chat people are no help and just say you?€?ll receive an email which as I?€?ve said I have never received an email to help me. Very upsetting that I will no longer be ordering with you due to the stress if there is anything wrong it doesn?€?t get resolved, I?€?m paying for a next day delivery service that doesn?€?t exist and the fact delays are always happening with my orders so I never know when they will arrive.",GB,Rated 1 out of 5 stars

I still don't have my refund. Emailing customer service or using live chat is like talking to a mentally disabled parrot with dementia. So many emails and when you finally think you are getting somewhere right back to the beginning again.

Sion,"November 08, 2022",Terrible.,"Terrible.3 weeks and still waiting for my order!Every day, I chatted with someone different, all giving me rubbish excuses and that the package will be sent soon, soon after a supposed 'IT' issue, as well as another saying it's an issue with the carrier. It's been a week and told the same; that their specialist team will contact me - what a lie.If they cared, surely someone could go and get the clothes I ordered, put them in a bag/envelope and send them.We won't be using them again!Update: tried to get a refund, as Under the Consumer Contracts Regulations your right to cancel an order starts the moment you place it and doesn't end until 14 days have passed from the day your goods were delivered to you, but they wouldn't even do that.disgusted",GB,Rated 1 out of 5 stars
Nanma Morgan,"September 12, 2022",Catch 22,"I am writing this in complete frustration after four weeks of trying to get a response from ASOS. They will not show my orders in my account and so I am unable to return items. I made an order. It was delivered a week later after no emails from ASOS. I wanted to return some items. When I successfully went into my account it repeatedly told me I had made no orders, making it impossible to trigger a return. ASOS will not speak to anyone on the telephone, but merely directs you to the chat box on its website. This only takes me round in circles, ending up telling me to open my orders in my account, which, of course, was my problem in the first place. Neither do they have an email address. So I am left unable to return my items. My bank has tried to help but as I actually received the order hey cannot reverse the money. PayPal have tried to help but they too are unable to make contact on my behalf. How is it possible for a multinational company, which has no actual shops that you could visit to explain your problem, have no email address or phone number for customers to explain  their problem. It may have been my mistake - it may have been theirs, but all I want is to have my account unlocked so that I can make a return. If ASOS is reading this, please respond.",GB,Rated 1 out of 5 stars

It Does not make sense that your people that are here to help on chat cannot perform a price adjustment. I placed this order because there was only one left and was worrying it would not be there if I did not. I figured your customer service agents  could adjust the price or do refund for the difference. Not sure why every other company has the ability to do this but yours.

I sent a screenshot twice showing my order and the discount amount and she still went back and forth. I really couldn?€?t believe she couldn?€?t do simple math and see for herself what I was saying was in fact true. I?€?m so disgusted with ASOS y?€?all have been getting a LOT of stuff wrong lately. You need to hire better people to do quality checks before an order is shipped. You also need to change your order screen to detail what % off they got during the time of purchase and to show the dollar amount of each item after the discount was applied. Just break everything down in detail to end all the confusion.

Charlotte Kinson,"November 02, 2022",Poor communication when orders go wrong,"Always found them fairly reliable until very recently. Order was dispatched, the day for delivery came and went, the tracking link still stated the courier was waiting to receive the item, so I figured there was a small delay, not the end of the world. Today I get a notification that 'as requested' my order has been refunded -  I didn't request it, didn't even receive the items, and there was no email from ASOS apologising for the order not materialising or explaining that anything had gone wrong to begin with. A bit frustrating, so I contacted their customer service and was put through to an agent who, after apologising for the inconvenience in a generic way, did not offer any information as to why this had happened or how to proceed - instead they disconnected my chat when I said this and asked if ASOS could send the items again. Started another chat, provided the chat number, immediately passed on to another agent. By the time I got to my third agent and after thirty minutes of being in the live chat, they apologised but could offer no insight into what had happened and why ASOS had not let me know there was a problem with my order. I shouldn't be finding out there's a problem with the arrival of a refund, I shouldn't have to reach out to ASOS to find out what has gone wrong. It's frustrating to not be given any clear communication that an order has been (presumably?) lost, or to be given the option for the items to be resent. A very weird lack of communication with the customer and it's put me off ordering from them again in future.",GB,Rated 1 out of 5 stars

I then reached out using the chat now option. It was like pulling teeth. Advisors kept ending the chat as soon as I asked for someone in charge, I spoke to about 10 people in one sitting. Not sure if the advisors were even in the country or understood English. I was explaining the problem like I was talking to a toddler and they still were not understanding. I went home at 11am this morning the evri tracking still showing the order was at depot. I reached out via email speaking to asos ellie, who advised if it still hadn?€?t been delivered at the end of the day, despite me already no longer being at the holiday address to re contact and then a refund process could begin. Back on the chat I went I spoke to 4 more advisors. All telling me don?€?t panic no worries you will get it tomorrow. I am so beyond frustrated. I explained over and over again I was on holiday I am no longer there and still it was no worries sit tight we are sure you will get it soon.

Asos then sent me an email not to contact them ever again regarding the issue and If I did they would not respond to me. Now I have no Idea why the account was closed. Contacted my bank they said the money has been debited already. I will not recommend anyone uses Asos. Especially when you?€?re ordering from Africa.

I then received the bag back and it was still in perfect condition with no scratches or damage, and the tags still there. I had since bought a different, smaller bag so don't need this one. Speaking to their customer service was useless. The bot just copies and pastes canned answers and it's impossible to speak to anyone. I've been assured that someone from customer service will be in touch with me but haven't had anyone get back to me for over a week.

The original packaging I recieved looke legit for the original item meaning someone in the warehouse part ot the returns team is messing around. They kept the item and swapped it for something else and I know this for a fact because Asos then sends an email saying they are sending the item back to me...If only I could attach images to this review - I recieved brown cut up fabric sent back to me that doesn't even match the same fabric of the trousers???? What? I ordered Stradivarius wide leg trousers in chocolate brown in size 10 and did not even try them on or open the package but that fabric was not what I recieved in the original parcel, it looked nothing like that even through the unopened plastic... the plastic around the item send back to me was different to the one I originally recieved which shows someone sent me some random crap while refusing to refund me.I have literally spent more than thousands over the past 14 years, why on earth would I (as a loyal customer) return brown fabric in replacement of the brown trousers to then claim a refund? Logically ot makes 0 sense.Additionally, it's pathetic when I often receive clearly returned items from Asos with makeup , perfume and thread tears.Be warned that if you return anything even when you have no tried it on or looked at it, someone in the warehouse part of the returns team may steal your items and replace it for their own amusement and lie so that you as the customer are left with the mess.I will sharing this story with images on another platform as I am extremely disgusted, dissapointed and shocked that Asos employs such individuals who do this. This is not ok and I am at my wits end with this company who I use to think highly of.Not anymore.Please be mindful if you are going to return items and you are a size 10 - someone out there working for asos is stealing returned items and messing around are the warehouse leaving us customers to pay.I no longer have trust in Asos and will be taking this further.",GB,Rated 1 out of 5 stars

When asked why, since it's not needed, they talk nonsense (such as telling me I'm using a different email, which they then confirm is the same/correct email - lies or incompetence?). Email support is no better - they don't read tickets properly, spend more time expressing fake concern than they do dealing with issues and don't listen to what their customers need, preferring to say ""we don't do that"".

miranda,"October 25, 2022",Very debatable if i will be ordering from them again,"I ordered 4 items from Asos, i waited around 4 days for the parcel to arrive and when they arrive 3 out of 4 items are missing. I didn't know what to do I went onto live chat and contacted them telling them what has happened. They explain how they're sorry and they offer me a refund of a replacement I opted for a refund as a pair of shoes that was missing was for my cousins bday so i asked her for a refund simply because I went to Nike and had to buy the shoes AGAIN just because if i ordered it again from Asos it wouldn't have come in time. She explains to me that i will be receiving a email to confirm the amount refunded, I first ask her on the chat to make sure its noted on the transcripts and im not receiving less money than im owed. I wait till the next day from when I was on live chat and i still haven't received the email. Yet this time when i go contact them they now tell me I have to wait 7-10 working days from today as its already been highlighted by the specialist team. I was confused as yesterday I wasn't told about 7-10 working days reply time and i wasn't told the 'specialist team' was doing anything in this. If i knew this I would've asked her for digital proof of all and I would've sent pictures to her of my damaged and missing items parcel.

And it was all attached with constant links for me to write reviews and spend more money. As a result I will never shop with asos again. When you have an issue with a very clearly faulty item it just isn?€?t worth the hassle. Asos do not value their customers and only care about you spending money. Even whilst they are treating you with contempt. The stress and drama simply isn?€?t worth it. Absolutely disgusting behaviour.

D.l,"October 25, 2022",Worst customer care experience I've?€?,"Worst customer care experience I've ever had!!!! Received a wrong size shirt (pretty expensive). The shirt was for a filming production. The chat agent placed a new order, and I asked him to confirm twice that I'll receive the right size this time and even wrote down the sizes conversion for every country. He assured me I'll receive the right one this time. However, received the wrong size again. From here I spent hours with a chat agent (Hariom) that kept apologizing and telling me that the best he can do is to make me (for the second time in one order) spend time during a work day, go print labels, pay for shipping it back and wait hours at the post office just so he can refund my money. Well, he is refunding me for a wrong item and giving me back MY money, but what about everything else, the freaking 20 days I'm waiting just to get wrong itemsTwice? My time? My extra shipping money? My frustration? The production that is missing the needed shirt a day before? NOTHING!!! I insisted on talking to a supervisor (Rythm), which didn't read or went through the conversation and told me they're sorry but my order didn't even leave the wear-house, and I needed to correct them and explain everything all over again just so I will get more apologies and the same answers. The highlight was that they used some identical saved replies which made me feel no one actually cares and it doesn't matter I'm talking to a human. Then was transferred to a floor manager (Peateek) for the same answers again, and was offered 15% code and then 20% and at the end 30% (excluding brands though my shirt was adidas and sales) which is insulting as ASOS has 25-30% randomly once a week. The manager closed the conversation after an hour an a half without giving me the code because I haven't replied for a few minutes, even though they could attach it to their last message regarding me not answering for a moment. I don't trust their customer care which everything but carrying for their customers. I caught them lying more then once and they even apologized for it. I felt like I was working for ASOS the past 2 weeks. I will start scouting for better alternatives.

Despite UK law stating faulty items should be refunded with the original payment method.Upon checking my account I saw I had an expired gift card I never knew about from a return on a pair of shoes I got in 2 sizes. In 2 years I have never been emailed to say I had expiring credit or prompted at the checkout to say I was in credit and have now lost ??40. ASOS are super rigid and unhelpful and won't reissue or extend the credit on good faith. The shoes were returned and because of the weekend they fell on 30 day return instead of 28 as per their policy. Spoken to customer services and they couldn't be more unhelpful in this situation.

I ordered across a few days from 31/08 and mixed-up the close of return date for the first order and the last order (last being 15/09) ?€? if it?€?s one or two items I?€?ve made peace with the reality and kept them before today, but all 4 orders totalled 29 separate items I was returning, and this order I now could not return was 11 separate pieces (mostly suit jackets / trousers).I contacted your customer care, who was lovely to recreate my returns for all orders, and asked me to return them promptly, I asked how I should send them as it was across 4 parcels (and limited parcel packing) I was assured that it did not matter which parcel each item went into as it was all going to the same place.As of today 20/10/22 , I have had 15 items refunded and some still processing from them 15.The other 14 I have no confirmation of in my email, and your customer care have told me I have to wait a further 10 working days, from today. I have spoken to several people on ?€?gnatta?€? who are happy to leave you for 15 minutes at a time, but will disconnect you if you don?€?t respond to them within 2 minutes - you do not get a notification when the advisor messages, so I have to keep my phone constantly?€? CONSTANTLY in hand. My last chat was 50+ minutes and I couldn?€?t even switch apps with ?€?gnatta?€? without it telling me I?€?ve disconnected from the colleague. This is beyond words of frustrating when I am pushed by colleagues to go back to my email, asos app, or follow a link, only to have to explain all this again and again when it finally reconnects.No one has escalated this for me. No one will call me. I have stressed, fretted, and sobbed over this.I paid on Klarna, and even with their snooze facility, I ran out of slack and had to pay it off with a credit card - assured in the knowledge that it would be refunded before my credit card bill is due.My credit card bill will be due before the 10 working days is up and I can?€?t afford my credit card bill. I have stressed to every colleague today of this being my reality - and the best advice I was given was to contact Klarna - who I have cleared my balance with since paying it with my Credit card, which leads me to conclude they don?€?t understand my issue despite multiple attempts to express my fear and problem, or they don?€?t care.I?€?m leaving this review not to be sour, I just want to warn others of the reality you might face if you play into their boastful brag of ?€?stress free 30 days / easy returns?€? Klarna was never the issue here, in fact their snooze gave me more peace than asos ever did for my problem.If they don?€?t process my refund soon, I will be charged interest for the first time in 10 years and I feel beyond stupid for ever having faith in a corporate entity. I have provided them proof of my return, I have broken down every single item by screenshot that is missing from my refund and I have spent hours and HOURS waiting on ?€?gnatta?€? for them to pull out a solution and still no end.  my wardrobe has been 95% asos for the last 5 years since their tall range blew up in variety.

Jessica Martin,"October 14, 2022","Stolen funds, randomly canceled order, non-existent customer service","Wow. This is hands down the most unbelievably poor excuse for good business practice I have ever in my life come across. I have already spent hours, days, trying to get my money back from a friend's birthday gift card voucher so unless this experience truly was as unbelievable as it has been, I truly wouldn't be able to bear any more time spent on this, but people should really know. I spent hours looking through maternity clothes on the site after my friend gifted (cursed) me with money toward ASOS. Because everything is moved from your cart to your saved items after just 1 hour of shopping, I spent enough time just transferring things back over once finally finished and felt rushed into ordering and stressed the entire time. It was $350 and meant for ever0-changing maternity body clothes, so please understand how it could take a bit longer than usual. I finally placed the order, with express 2-day paid shipping so it would arrive prior to my leaving for vacation a week later. Then, 24 hours later, I receive an email from ASOS saying that my order has been spontaneously canceled due to ""suspicious account details"". Hmmm.... Now what oh earth would be suspicious about an account which had confirmed email and phone number, an address under my name, and a less than 1 month old gift card covering the entire amount?? It was at this point I discovered that there is next to ZERO customer service. No phone, no email, the only option for you when a company like ASOS has straight up stolen your entire gift card is to chat with people who will readily admit they can do absolutely nothing to help you with your order. Its a call center, but not even because there is no one you can actually speak to whatsoever. Instead they will tell you that they have ""escalated"" your issue to a department which will be able to explain what happened to you via an email which you won't even be able to respond to. After 3-4 separate chats on separate occasions, days without hearing back from this mysterious and absolutely useless department which essentially investigates itself to find out why it did this kind of thing to you, not ever even one hearing back from a supervisor which I asked to speak to several times; I finally get an email saying that they have unblocked my account and I can go ahead and keep shopping now! No answers as to why this happened, no refund for the express shipping making the arrival date days prior to even getting a response back from customer service, and the best part.. No way to even reposed to the email as it's a no-reply. So now here I am, with less money on the voucher than before and absolutely no interest in ever ordering from or dealing with ASOS again and no way to cancel the charge for the purchase of the gift card because they have now a week plater decided to go ahead and put money back onto the card that I never want to use or see ever again. Half the items I wanted to order originally, now gone. A very very thoughtful and generous gift from a close friend that was completely destroyed by the stress and lack of service caused by ASOS customer and quality care. I reiterate, not ONLY, was I not offered even an explanation, no offer to make up for this ridiculous fiasco, no voucher, but get this; not even all of the money BACK spent in the first place for an order that I have had to move to the cart 15 times, order 3 times, and ""chat"" with useless help about a number of times. Absolutely no recourse whatsoever. A blocked account for 5 days to not even be able to access the order or history of it. I can't stress enough the ridiculousness of this ""company"" all I can say is that it's primarily a scam if you let them get away with it and this company should not be in business.",US,Rated 1 out of 5 stars

They told me this is not allowed and I MUST pay on the us store with the voucher even though I DONT LIVE IN THE US. I was never informed of this caveat when I returned the item, If I had known this I would have kept the item and sold it myself so I could get some money back.
