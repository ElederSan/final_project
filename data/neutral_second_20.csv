5ecd776d25e5d209b8f54806,Displeased,26/05/2020,3,"Overall I do not have a problem with Amazon. Admittedly, the delivery service has been slow since COVID 19,but I can accept that.  I can not accept that there have been two occurrences when I place an order and then the item simply disappears. The item is still for sale but for triple the price or more. Of course when you contact customer service they claim the item is no longer available which is dishonest and untrue. I do not believe this is a way to run a company but perhaps customers matter less when the owner is a billionaire.",US
5ec9c85125e5d20a889dc5d4,What's going on with Amazon deliveries lately?,24/05/2020,3,"I ordered two of the exact same sweatshirts from Amazon 2 weeks ago. The only thing different was the color. One of them arrived within four to five days. The other one never arrived although I kept checking the shipment status. I finally got a notification that it was undeliverable as addressed and it was sent to another address. Seriously? It was from the same order, same address, same everything.How could one get there with no problem and the other one couldn't find its way to my home....so they just sent it back to the ""third party shipper""?  My account was credited, but I question how one part of my order arrived with no problem but for the other part of the order they couldn't find me?",US

5ec572cb25e5d20a889b11f5,The Amazon search tool is horrible,20/05/2020,3,"The Amazon search tool is horrible and frustrating. Example: I put in ""famotidine"" (in quotes) then select ""lowest to highest"" and the search engine gives me 26 products that are not ""famotidine"", it's not until the 27 product that I see Pepcid, which is also not the lowest price for this medication. Here's another example: ""CBD"" returns pages of products, none of which are CBD, they area all Hemp Oil. After researching it, Amazon doesn't sell CBD.  The search engine is designed to promote selling stuff instead of helping the customer find what he or she is actually looking for. Finally Amazon needs to have a ""customer feedback"" feature but you don't so apparently your not interested in hearing things like this.",US

5ec1910b25e5d209b8ed82ed,"Think twice before ordering from - Do a quick search, bet you will get better, personal service",17/05/2020,3,"Think twice before ordering from Amazon.  Amazon has been a very decent outlet to purchase items.  Recently, I've learned to take a look at items sold locally in the US.  I ordered a pair of professional nail clippers.  Not realizing it, I ordered them from overseas and learned that it would take over a month to get the order.  I looked around and found a cheaper pair in Florida and and had them within 5 days over a weekend, regular mail.  The worst is I ordered a card table.  Easy right.  It would take another month to get it, which was good timing for me.  It was shipped by UPS, Amazon put a hold on it and directed UPS to stop shipment.  When I called UPS, they said I had to contact Amazon at the their website address.  There was nothing else that I could do.  Went to contact Amazon and it was a BOT-computerized; no customer service, no help site.  I re-ordered the card table from Amazon because now I needed it and couldn't wait any longer.  After several days passed, my 2nd order for the card table was not even processed.  I decided to look around and found the exact table at Bed Bath and Beyond.  I ordered it online for the same price with a coupon and it was at my door in less than a week.  I cancelled my order at Amazon.  My business will decrease significantly at Amazon.  I don't like how you treat your employees and your service is no longer acceptable.",US

5ebd879225e5d20a8895ca33,Overall amazon have been pretty good…,14/05/2020,3,Overall amazon have been pretty good but I have been ripped off by a company I ordered buttons from. They are very late everyday they send an email once I’ve demanded a refund. Everyday it says they are arriving if not. One back tomorrow for a refund. I’ve tried emailing amazon and complaining as obviously I cannot live chat  to anyone . But you can’t even do that it sends you to an entirely different screen so  sadly amazon you are as bad as the ripOff company you have allowed to trade via you,GB
5ebd6d3425e5d20a8895af6d,"Amazon, wake up... you have the virus!",14/05/2020,3,"Two months ago I would have given them 5 stars. I have been an Amazon Prime member for a couple of years now. I have always loved this company and web site.., and then came covid-19!!! I am not complaining about the slower (much slower) shipping... we all have to adjust to aid each other. What I am talking about is their product line & what they have aided Chinese companies in doing. For instance: I wanted to find “hand sanitizer.”  If you go to the other well-known ‘brick and mortar’ sites you will find it marked, “Out of stock” and there will be no “cheap” substitutes. Amazon owes it to their customers to maintain some quality control. Instead they are stocking many, very many substitutes that did not exist before. Also, they have allowed the price on “junk” to go through the roof. Read the review, the comments on these outrageously priced & newly appearing Chinese made hand sanitizers. It is absolutely nothing but a rip-off. Amazon should start listing items as “sold out” & stop aiding these companies with no quality control in flooding our markets with overpriced garbage. It is Amazon’s good name that will suffer. We expect Amazon to do at least a little policing of the products they sell, and prices that have quadrupled in a month’s time. I hope the Amazon name will mean as much “post” covid-19 as it did “pre” covid-19!!!",US

Because I contacted the vendor a second time asking where is my item Amazon says I have to wait 48 hours for a response before they can do anything. Doesn’t matter I already contacted the vendor once before. They don't care that my money is gone and the product is way over due.Amazon may contact the vendor, maybe file an A to Z complaint and another month goes by and Amazon has my money. I don’t know if I have to contact Amazon again to make this happen. Amazon could have read the complaints from all the other people who have not gotten the product, but chose not to.Amazon has removed this item from their site like the other 2 items I had the same issue with.I told Amazon I would file a dispute with my bank and they said, go ahead file a dispute with you bank.This is the third time something like this has happened. What has happened to customer service? What happened to Amazon backs their items? Why is Amazon taking customer money so quickly for items before they are shipped? Do they not trust their third party vendors? Amazon is",IN

I contacted amazon to check up on it the day beforw it was due to arrive and they send me an email that my order was cancelled due to stock availability. When I ordered the bike it was in stock so how can they sell items that are not in stock?!!  Also if there was an issue like that that could of informed me so I could shop elsewhere. If it wasn’t me chasing them I don’t even know if they would of let me know at all!!! I contacted them again and it didn’t feel like they cared at all. I do understand current circumstances but you just can’t put smth out for sale when it’s not in stock?!?! Now I ended up having no gift for my sons birthday. Never was So disappointed tbh.

However, when I share my reviews, only the positive ones get posted. Also, lately, as much as l would like to be understanding of the special circumstances of the pandemic and the confusion it has created, i find myself more inconvenienced than what it is reasonable, from my perspective. When ordering supplies; whether because of unavailability of it, or at times showing available items on the site, yet not been able to order them. For one reason or another not been able to place items in the ""cart."" I have tried to reach customer service to place the order, when in real need of an item. Customer Service hashad a recording which states it is also unavailable? Is there something going on I am not getting? I wish I could stick to this site...but it's been kind of challenging to do so. Hope it can improve and that it is just a temporary situation. Thanks. Denise.",US

Luckily since Lockdown started I am not going out much only for food shopping as food shopping online is impossible.Usually very good having purchased face masks, a digital thermometer for my mother which came with a dead battery ( I had to change it) but it works fine for her now.And for a number of law books for me which they have normally been very good at delivery and the Flash Speed mop which I tried to get in stores but gave up and got it in Amazon.I do like Amazon but on one occasion items have been delivered to next door instead of our address and it's a good job they are honest neighbours.Good but could be better as my items are unnecessarily being delayed by up to a month now as a Prime customer with essential items they should not be delayed.",GB

It seems that when they went to their own delivery system and started to promise 1 day deliveries, that the issues have happened. Several item have been lost in shipping.At least 1 of the items was bought and fulfilled by Amazon. 1st item got lost, I got a refund because item was no longer available,and ordered a similar item. 2nd item got lost. Called customer service which issued a re-shipping order which did nothing. After several more days I got on their help center.Went through 4 customer service people. At that point I was so disgusted that I told them I lost faith in the system. They recommend that I order from a different vendor at $10.00 more for the same item and that they would pay the expedited shipping. I told them that the $10.00 more was the expedited shipping cost and that I did not feel that I should pay for their problem. They said when I get my item, I should ask for a refund of the difference. We'll see how it works out.Later,I did order the other part and did contact them once I received it. I also copied and pasted from the previous chat that I had saved so it was per their instructions being fed back to them. They not only issued a refund but also refunded the whole amount of the purchase. I guess they knew I was upset. I think I'm back on track with them.",US

My personal card was charged on my company's business account for Prime. So I called in and the rep told me he would refund my card and give me prime for free for the next year. Sounds nice, right? Next thing I know, the prime membership on the company is canceled! I call in and they say the rep promised me something they can't fulfill (she will send a message to his manager to make sure he knows this for the future.. gee thanks) and he also canceled my membership, but ""no worries"" you can just sign up again on the sign up page. So about the promise, I argued with the rep saying a company such as Amazon should stand behind what their reps, even if the rep made a mistake. We had it out for a few minutes until she said she can offer me a partial promotional credit to my account for compensation. It was almost the full amount so I consented. About the continued membership, ""no worries, just sign up from your end because we can't do it from our end."" Oh, but when I go to the sign up page, the price for business prime is now $179 and we were paying $119! Even after emailing and complaining that I got into this mess from a rep that made a bad mistake, it's not my fault that my membership was cancelled and if it hadn't been I would be still paying the lower rate, every rep who emails me just tells me the same thing: Our terms changed and we ""offer Business Prime Memberships for Business Account where the customers can simply make purchases and avail two-day free shipping. This completely for a free shipping purpose and the other benefits of prime will not be given."" Sounds like it should be cheaper, right? $60 more than standard prime for personal accounts. Not getting anywhere with Amazon and very frustrated with ""Earth's Most Customer-Centric Company.""**After calling back and asking to speak with a manager, I was able to sign up again for the business prime and he will refund me for the difference of $60 this one time. He said as of next year standard prime will no longer be available for business accounts so then I will have to make my decision but for now, he gave me the lower rate for Business prime. Now we're talking sense. Thank God for managers",US

Every time I click on anything to do with music, it takes me to a page to sign up for their Amazon Music Unlimited at an additional charge.  Even when I click on something that says Amazon Music that says it is included with my Prime membership, it takes me to a page to sign up for the new service at an additional charge.  I feel like I should contact a lawyer and start a class action suit because there are millions of people who have sign ed up for Prime with the understanding that they can stream music with their membership, but Amazon is effectively removing the benefit that we have already paid for and trying to force us to sign up for their new service at an addition charge.

I received an email at 4 pm that night saying they tried to deliver but no one was home. I have two dogs that would have alerted me if someone was at the door.Then when I called to complain that they never tried to deliver the package the people on the phone where rude.

She explained they where calling the wrong number despite the notes in the system giving the correct phone number. She actually changed my number so the organization could contact me when they were delivering.Today I was given another 4 hour window. I called to try and find a smaller window explaining I have things I need to get done (the stuff I couldn't get done last weekend because I waited all day).

They have shipped a few wrong orders, though I was able to get them replaced fairly easily, it was hours on the phone, and running in to mail a package back to them. The reason I ordered from Amazon with that purchase was that I needed it fast with the wrong order being sent twice was not able to use it. Then even more recently I have found that all the Amazon apps are kinda completely annoying. I used to have kindle, shopping, video and music apps. The problem is that when I tried to use my husband's account that has prime for the shopping app and my account for everything else, it would sign me out of all the apps on my phone. There seems to be no option to sign in with different accounts for different apps. Also my husband got a few months of kindle unlimited for free, and I have found that any book that I have shared with my husband he cannot read because they will not download.

Trouble is, it's not always your porch. I have pointed this out several times but they'd rather shine you On with an obligatory sorry and a couple of bucks. Not to mention you pay an additional $119. for Prime -  1 to 2 day shipping . This week I ordered And promised my 5 yr. Old granddaughter a Dodger hat, glove, and 2 balls by Wednesday. Wrong. Wrong porch. Told them and said send driver lbackout to get and redilever. Nope, too easy, will resend. Another two days. Hat came in mail, thank goodness. Promised my granddaughter a Dodger hat n ball to help make up for it. Supposed to get Friday. Wrong again. Same porch, not mine. Sent text as soon as I got the picture and quite aggravated now with a crying granddaughter i immediately send a text to send driver back out now and pick up my items and deliver to me. That didn't happen. Next day I find the obligatory sorry again. Was quite upset by now and have to take nitroglycerin tabs for the chest pains they created and let them know it too. So needless to say, no reply, no baseball no bat and no resolution. Could that driver live there or know someone there?? Does that person need glasses??? I'm my opinion Amazon condones the theft of packages not belonging to addresses not to mention opening other people's mail. Found out open someone's mail from your mailbox. It's a federal pffense. You give it back. I guess when you get that big you can treat common people however you want. They should remember when they weren't so big and who helped them get there. I'm a big Dodger can having been born in NYC. First game I went to and only games were Brooklyn Dodgers. Now we carry the torch for LA Dodgers. This is so disappointing how they treat people. Thank you Trustpilot, for listening.  And here it is Monday and you guessed it. No bat, no ball no response,no consideration for the consumer. Why would you think I ordered that. To see someone else get it. So much for 20 + years in the military. My husband fought in Korean war and two tours in Vietnam and he can't even get our 5/6 year old granddaughter some Dodger stuff. Guess that's a thank you for your service we'll not soon forget. But don't waste any time collecting that $119. Prime membership. Soery, yes, we're quite upset.",US

I tried dealing with the customer service reps to resolve with no success, so I filed a fraud alert on my credit card. Since then this has happened twice more, Yesterday I chatted online with the customer service rep who informed me there was nothing they could do to stop these unwanted transactions. After 39 minutes of trying to reason with them that there must be a way to stop it, I realized I must be now part of Rod Sterling's program, The Twilight Zone. In frustration I called the credit card company and cancelled the card since as long as they had the number on file they just kept adding the gift reloads for $100 and then sending two $50 play stations which depleted my gift card which they then reloaded which created another order for pay stations. After cancelling the card they informed me I needed to contact them with new credit information. Really?

But there are these aggravating issues: (1) Their auto packing tosses items into one huge box, frequently with insufficient packing materials, and I have had so many broken items I no longer order items such as prime pantry (2) Because they do put as much as possible in one box it is frequently too heavy for me to handle and is frequently put in front of my door so I cannot open the door and have to walk around the house to move it to the other side, which any sensible delivery person would realize (3) Amazon's newer delivery service that I guess is avoid using the post office involves a number of different carriers, some of which are so poor that I have to call customer service...once because an item was just tossed into a snow bank on my driveway, another when it was tossed onto a dark driveway where it was smashed, or I suddenly got a notice that no one was there to accept the package and I NEVER changed from unattended package instructions (4) sometimes the delivery person leaves the package at my back door, where it does not occur to me to search for packages, so sometimes it is there for a few days before I realize it was delivered (5)when you are expected to say why you are returning an item you get a list of options that for me have seldom included any item connected with why I am returning it so I just mark off any one of them and hope for the best (5) if you ever get an email address or phone no. for Amazon customer service cling onto it because if you try to get that by an inquiry on the Amazon search you will never find it there.

When someone sells something so bad, such as the quality of a CD film, how can you as a private buyer stop them from selling more junk to the public ?This type of sellers don´t want any ratings, so from there they are protected from further scam. When the item had been sold for a low price the you completely loose in the transaction as you don´t want to be involved in a return fight where you absolutely don´t know wher it will stop. Amazon gives strong indication that they do not care selling such low quality items as it is impossible to contact them and with no rating activated for the seller, there is not much you can do and impossible to warn others.",DE

Sadly, you don't get free delivery, you have to first spend $35 or more to get free 2 hour delivery. If not, they'll charge you $4.99 for delivery. Why can't it be free no matter the cost? Membership cost is ridiculous, but yet, it's not free or maybe $0.99.2) Prime Video app does not support 'Chromecast' so that we can cast shows and movies to TV's.

The shipping dept is LOUSY and must be poorly run. One in four packages we receive are poorly packed, have no bubbly wrap to protect the products or poorly boxed and shipped. This probably has to do with the volume they are processing BUT they need more personnel if it is not being done right. Where are the supervisors? My guess is that no one is paid what they should be paid to work or supervise at the company. Another reason to hate Bezos and his only interest being seemingly in profit and the bottom line and not in the customers' experiences. Typical corporate America.

I'm simply going to deal with them cautiously.My first complaint is their search algorithm.  Last night, I was looking for watches.  Amazon's initial search returned over 10,000 results.  I didn't want to wade through 10,000 result so I decided to change the sort from [Default] to [Price Low to High].  I didn't narrow the search in ANY way.The new results dropped to 100.  I literally lost over 9,900 purchase options.  I was forced to go back to the previous search results and wade through a ton of crap that was of no interest to me.  It literally too me a half hour to find a Timex watch that should have shown up on the low end of prices when I changed the sort order but it was eliminated in those results.  What the hell is that???My next complaint is that they've changed their ""Two Day Shipping"" policy.  I understand that this change occurred some time ago but the point is that you have to pay attention to WHEN the item ships.  Two days is no longer calculated from the date of order but from the date of ship.  In some cases, shipping won't occur for a couple of weeks!My third complaint is that their customer service used to be automatic.  They would take responsibility when things went wrong and they'd offer a resolution without even being asked.  Today, getting Amazon to take responsibility for broken promises is like pulling teeth.  I used to give them 5 stars for customer service but today, I'd be hard pressed to give them anything more than 2.5.Bottom line.  Amazon is no longer the go-to for me and I shop around before placing ANY orders there.  Besides finding better pricing in other places, there are many browser add-ons and apps that offer me additional savings or money back on my purchases with other retailers.I would have given them 2 stars but I do get some use out of the included streaming benefit.",US

Due to that stupid Google vs Amazon discussion, you can't stream via Chromecast (yeah, cast via computer = annoying as it's in the other room and screen mirroring on mobile isn't reliable).Amazon's Firestick isn't available in NZ... Roku is shipped to NZ but then the Amazon Prime channel isn't available. Unless you do the VPN trick but then Amazon blocks videos that should be available in NZ. It's just impossible to use Amazon Prime in NZ. Cancelled the subscription. Back to the more-or-less-crappy alternatives, we have here.",NZ

I purchased a bunk bed online at a great price.  Well apparently it was priced incorrectly and they cancelled my order with out notifying me.

I ordered it several days ago.  Amazon's terms and conditions state that they will notify you.  Well they violated their contract.  I had plans for the bunk bed.  Now my granddaughters old beds will be picked up on Wednesday and they will have no bed!  Thank you amazon for not holding up your end of the bargain.  A purchase is a contract and I held up my end, they did not. Also they are not refunding me for 7-10 days so I can't even go to a store and buy a bed until they give me the money to.  This is by far the worst experience I have ever had with amazon.  And I have been an avid Amazon promoter and shopper for several years.

Doing so, does not translate to an endorsement of a book, rather informative to the audiences worldwide. The AMAZON prominence position them to champion this option.

Not for free movies and books.  When I contacted them about service I got a small credit and a story about warehouses in strategic locations for expedited shipping.  Really don't care about how many warehouses they have or if they have to swap stock items between warehouses.  I order something, then I expect it delivered in 2 or 3 days because I paid for prime shipping.  End of story to me.  Not Amazon's story.  I have repeatedly had to navigate their site to send a message regarding delivery.  Normally their shipping and delivery estimates are off I am waiting and waiting for my item to be processed then shipped.  The waiting 3 5 or 6 days on them to ship something and then see it expedited doesn't make me happy..  Well, what bothers me is that because their swapping between warehouses isn't my fault, but the checkout button says I can pay more to have stuff shipped when it becomes available.  I already paid for prime.  So when I order 4 things in 1 cart order - my entire orders sits.  I started making separate orders for a while and then often I needed something that is a +$25 add on item.  Just tired over amazon's game.",US

Our money was held for a very long time (we did not get paid for months) and what we here this is the norm.  We also listed my Company phone number (expensive items) so customers could call to confirm we were the real deal. Most were asking for our number from Amazon, as customers of high end item want to Many want to talk to a human, not a computer.  Amazon did not like this, gave us a hard time, so we no longer sell on Amazon.

Howver, regarding boots, shoes, and some other goods:While shopping for boots have you ever noticed the same model of the same brand is said to run big on one site, small on another, get 5 stars here, or three stars there? People from one site swear by this brand or this style, others have nothing but complaints? I have been in the re-sale business of shoes for several years now and have noticed several interesting quirks when researching and reselling shoes. The era of 6pm and Amazon have (unfortunately) created loopholes for customers who think they can count on a brand name (even Frye, Keen, Sorel, etc) for quality. 6pm and Amazon frequently (if not always) sell cheaper low quality versions. For example: The boots you buy from the company are all leather with a leather sole and welted construction (sole sewn to the boot) for example, but Amazon's are glued together with rubber soles. Full grain leathers are used on the company's boots, split leathers are used on the others. I don't know why the brand's allow for this blatant misuse of their names and logos (except that it must be profitable), but be aware that what you are buying through these companies will not last and is not the quality you may be expecting.",US

I have had some problems with some returns--not getting a full refund on products on I returned because of the seller's policy. I had some difficulties with a merchant this Christmas, but the merchant handled the problem to my satisfaction. You just have to be careful that the merchant does not charge a restocking or return fee, especially if the mistake was the merchant's fault. My husband ordered an item from a seller on amazon and it was defective. When he contacted the company, they sent him a return address label but it was not prepaid, so we had to pay the shipping fee to return it. I told him he should have refused to pay for return shipping since the item was defective, and he needs to mention that in his review of the seller. Overall, though, I have had mostly positive experiences with amazon and will continue to use them. You can find almost any type of item on amazon, which makes shopping with them very convenient.",US

It offers less options than Netflix (by far). The free kindle rental offers a wide selection of books you've never heard of before while restricting any popular book series to purchase only. To top it all off the free 2-day shipping has been horrendous. Out of my last 10 orders, 4 of them have not made it by the day they promised. I have called customer service every time and they have simply said, it will be there tomorrow. It's a GUARANTEE. Yet they act like it's no big deal that your shipment isn't going to make it by the time they promised.

I called Amazon because I wanted to return it, I didn't want to deal with the mess and I was told that it was a liability for them to get it back from me. But it was ok for ME to get broken glass? I don't think so! So after I talked to the customer service rep and tell him/her about proper ways to ship items they offered me a new shipment of the same item. I was not happy. <<<< Fast forward 2 days later >>>> I get the new shipment in the mail. And yes, it was BROKEN, AGAIN! Shattered to small pieces, made nothing! So again I'm on the phone with someone in customer service who can't really change anything in the warehouse wanted to send me a replacement!

It arrived in one day - door is no way reversible on THIS EXACT model. Luckily we don't care except I don't like being misled. This is not the first time I've discovered this practice - check out Amazon purchaser reviews of Panasonic NNT-945SF Microwave or Green Mountain Nantucket Blend K-Cups.

The problem with Amazon is that when you have faulty goods or problems they arent always very helpful. I had a hardware fault which was an inherent manufacturer defect but Amazon said i had no rights to claim a repair or replacement from them (They say the Sale of goods act is a load of rubbish) i had to go through the courts in the end to get them to deal with my faulty goods. Also bad if you have to return damaged goods, its at your own expense and in most cases they dont even pay back the cost of your postage charges of recorded delivery so the item is traceable in the mail.Not a good way for a company to work.",GB

4f2ef63b000064000216b529,Great for buying not so great for selling,05/02/2012,3,You'd think with how simple it is to buy on Amazon they'd implement a similar system for sellers. Instead they have something which is over complicated and annoying. For example the BIZARRE system they implement with the postage fees and the various levels of sellers which you have to be high up on to be able to even OFFER *free* postage?!I don't like buying from Amazon market place either. I generally only buy from Amazon themselves or sellers who are fulfilled by Amazon. Not good for Amazon sellers.,GB
4f294f2500006400021661ce,shipping fee is high,01/02/2012,3,"ordered stuff that took kinda long to arrive, and the shipping fee for an item is relatively high especially when they consider the item is 'special' with extra handling fee",HK

They're just such a big company that you feel like you get lost in the system. There is no ""one-on-one"" type feeling when you call them. You're just another number.",US
4f1e30f5000064000215ab73,I do love Amazon,24/01/2012,3,You can find ANYTHING here! At a very competitive price BUT...if I am ordering more than one item at a time...I shop elsewhere because items are shipped out from different places and the shipping is high :(,US

4f1b26050000640002158810,Needs works,21/01/2012,3,Great place to search for products and see what's available but the website needs filters to help your search - such as price filters to make searching for items easierGreat that they offer free postage on a wide range of items and give discount if u buy a certain item regularly by opting to subscribe. This gives an even better price,GB

4eed0e51000064000213102d,Not bad but lacking,17/12/2011,3,"I was looking for iPod touch 3 in 1 chargers for my kids iPod's for Christmas and even though the 'sellers' advertised 'free shipping' or 'shipped in time for Christmas' when I got to check out every time, there was either a $9.00 shipping charge for a $3 charger, OR there was some outrageous shipping date like shipped by December 28th. I settled for paying the extra cost for shipping to get it here on time, but may just stick to craigslist, eBay, or half.com for my next purchase.",US
4ee638c5000064000212a9d6,"Good website, but only if there are no problems.",12/12/2011,3,"Generally a good website and i love they fact they have almost everything i could ever want.  The Marketplace facility is also a great thing.  Generally delivery is very, very quick (i have received some things within 24 hours of ordering with normal delivery), but have had some problems trying to get things sorted when things have gone wrong.My big problem at the moment is my Kindle which failed.  It is a covered under warranty, but because i bought it at Atlanta airport while i was transiting, it has to be replaced in America.  As i don't live there, or have family/friends who do, it has meant having the replacement sent to a friend of a friend who will then send it to me.  Not exactly ideal, and i will still need to pay the costs to have it shipped from the US to Europe.  I also have to pay those costs to have the old one sent back (although i'm assuming these will be reimbursed).  This to me is a ridiculous system for an international company the size of Amazon.  They could easily have sorted it out to be sent to Europe, or be sent from a European warehouse, or even taken up my offer of paying any difference in price between the European model and the US one.  It's all a bit of a farce.",NL

Eventually had to change delivery address to get the goods 4 weeks after Christmas.Careful which delivery option you choose!,AU

Even if they ship, the shipping cost is awkwardly high (for example, I was ordering few articles totalling to 50 USD and the shipping charge on them was 180 USD)If I really need something from Amazon, I need to give an US address and then ask someone to carry it to India for me.Had the shipping been regular to India, I, as well as many I know, would have definitely used a lot of service from Amazon.",IN
