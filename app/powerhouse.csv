65b7ceeb1ff09ac96806181d,I bought a Taurus ws7 multigym from‚Ä¶,2024-01-29,1,"I bought a Taurus ws7 multigym from them and assembled it over 2 weeks ago. Initially I had a problem with tensioning the cables so sent them an email but figured it out a few hours later. The unit is great apart from one design fault. When lowering the seat into its lowest position, the welds of the box section touch the plastic insert, so after my first go on the machine, the edges of the insert snapped off and went into the the machine. Now the seat has no support and is so wobbly, I can even use it now, so much for 'semi professional use'! I sent a follow up email with a video of the problem and that I had already fixed the tension problem, but 3 days later responded to the first email. I then sent another email telling them to reply to my seat problem and they replied another 4 days later with ""send us a picture or video"", which I already did! So I've sent them the same video AGAIN along with a picture. It has now been nearly a week without a response and I cannot use the equipment I've spent ¬£1500 on.The lack of customer service is disgusting, not only from them, their German arm, Sport Tiedje who I bought the pulley accessory from to go with it. I paid for it 19 days ago and the courier still hasn't even picked it up from them!Avoid both of these companies like the plague, I will never buy a thing from them ever again.",GB

65a670383c3950fb4d1eb154,Fantastic experience and extraordinary work ethic from installers,2024-01-11,5,"What a pleasure it is to write a review like this.  I would give more than 5 stars if I could.I ordered a Life Fitness G7 and Bench (fantastic product) from Powerhouse Fitness.   The advice and ordering/installation process was very professional.The installation guys were unbelievable.   The basics: they turned up on time, were very polite, worked fast, took all the mess away etc.    However, during the installation, there was an accident involving a brand new box cutter blade.   One of those real left field accidents rather than any lack of concentration.   It was a deep, nasty cut and I went outside to find the guys trying to put a temporary fix to it so they could finish the job and not leave me half finished.   It was a definite A&E job but they were considering superglueing the wound shut to buy some time!   Their willingness to do this, including the guy who was clearly in pain, is extraordinary and speaks volumes for their customer focus and work ethic.  It was certainly no lack of regard for their colleague, on the contrary.  He was urging them to crack on too!In the end, I drove him up to A&E before returning home to a completed installation, nice and clean with a calm handover (and a thank you gift from them which was not needed but lovely of them).   They then went off to the hospital to see him.This would have been 5 stars even without this incident but the guys were brilliant and very worthy of merit.  Thank you!",GB

658d57101f40cbd2eaef40bf,DO NOT BUY FROM THIS FIRM,2023-12-28,1,"DO NOT BUY FROM THIS FIRM. Their courier is sub class and you'll find deliveries taking forever, furthermore their customer service (although very pleasant) is designed to make it difficult to cancel or return and item.My order of 2-5 days has gone to 7 which is fine given it's christmas yet they can't give me an update on my order as their courier has a 48hr response time!! Therefore, they simply don't know what's happening. When I asked to cancel they said they'd need to wait for courier to return to them and then it would take 10-15 days to refund. Meaning I have to 1) trust their dodgy courier and 2) wait ages for my refund.I then suggested they provide some compensation and they said they weren't liable for 3rd parties. THEIR OWN CHOSEN 3RD PARTY.DON'T BUY FROM THESE GUYS, HONESTLY NOT WORTH THE HASSLE***UPDATE - I PROVIDED MY CONTACT NUMBER 2 DAYS AGO YET NO CONTACT FROM FIRM AND STIL L NO UPDATE FROM COURIER. CUSTOMER SERVICE IS NOW BECOMING POOR***",GB
658c7a1c34e83b769e94da49,Worst customer experience I‚Äôve ever had,2023-09-27,1,"Here are the only good things I have to say: the initial sales experience was good, the delivery was prompt, and installation of one of the pieces of equipment was faultless.However, my experience with this company after this was nothing short of atrocious.1) One of the items was missing parts and rusted inside. It didn‚Äôt look brand new, or like it had been properly stored and was not of the same quality as another item received. We had to specifically ask for a partial refund, and it took 64 days to process that refund from the day we raised this issue.2) The installation team left several marks and dents on our walls and ceilings. As this is a paid for service, I would expect them to be extremely careful when installing and, at the very least, inform you if any damage had been caused. The installers didn‚Äôt mention anything to us about it! Make sure you check the area thoroughly if you are getting equipment installed.3) One piece of equipment was incorrectly described on their website. It was about 10cm taller than advertised, meaning we wouldn‚Äôt have ordered it. While this was sorted between the installation team and the Powerhouse Fitness sales team on the day and the installers disassembled it and took it away the same day, it took Powerhouse Fitness 45 days to process the refund for this item. Getting this refund took countless chaser emails and phone calls, and we were just always told it was ‚Äòwith the Accounts Team‚Äô. I‚Äôve just checked the item page today, and the description is still wrong, even though two people told us it had been sent to the site team to correct.4) On top of the wrongly described item refund taking so long, we also had to battle for Powerhouse Fitness to refund us the installation fee we had paid for that item. Again, countless back and forth emails had to happen before they would cover that cost. That refund took 88 days from the installation date to be processed (and would have been even longer if we hadn‚Äôt sent yet another chaser email).Generally, communication both with customers and within the company itself are not at a high enough standard to provide good customer service for the price of the items they are selling. The after-sales experience is unacceptable, and the teams don‚Äôt seem to talk to each other in order to sort things out in a timely manner.If you have any issues with your order or installation, be prepared to wait months for a resolution, have people tell you they will do something and never do it, and constantly chase things up until they are sorted.",GB

When I told the operator all she said was yeah xdp aren't very good, I'll have to wait 24/48 hours for them to respond and see if I get my item. Nevermind the fact I took days off work to be in for the delivery and now I need to wait around another time if and when they decide to attempt to actually deliver it. No real support from powerhouse, didn't seem to care and to also tell us we are wrong and the driver has been to the correct address twice though we have told them twice it is not our house, puts me off ordering with them in the future, will probably stick with strengthshop as you get your orders when expected.",GB

I have been promised tomorrow (another day off work) so let‚Äôs see. I contacted Powerhouse customer service who said they would speak to the courier. Mmmm! Just don't expect a fast delivery on the item you buy unless maybe if you live near Glasgow which seems to be their storage depot. South of England buyers will struggle to see it for at least 7 days.

Powerhouse customer services have been dealing with this problem for 2 weeks now and meanwhile I am busy contacting them instead of working out on my bike. Some days I can‚Äôt now exercise as the bike is my only option. The company have suggested I use the warranty as they looked at a video of the bike and said it seemed faulty, but I do not want to repair a brand new bike! It hardly inspires confidence in the bike brand ( Life Fitness). I have spent ¬£2000 on it. I have asked for a refund as the bike is not as described but there is a distinct lack of urgency or any notion of speedily resolving the problem so that the customer, if not entirely happy, is not saddled with a bike which does not work properly as well as  being out of pocket and having to keep contacting their indifferent customer services.Steer clear of the company.",GB
