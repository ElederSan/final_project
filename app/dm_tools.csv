I needed a replacement dust extractor fast, so I was delighted when it arrived the next day, even though I was advised of a 1-3 day delivery.I chose the smallest unit from the CamVac series (CGV286-3), as it's compact size (36 L) is ideal for my small work space. The suction of this small unit is a massive upgrade to my old extractor. With the 63mm adaptor fitted, it connects straight to my DeWalt table saw outlet. The suction is so strong, you can visibly see the 63mm hose contract once the unit is switched on. My workshop as never been so clear of dust, which is important as I cut a lot  of MDF.",GB
